One of the main advantages of ThoughtSpot Embedded is the control over the styling and UI elements provided by the Visual Embed SDK.

This tutorial will walk through controlling the various essential aspects of UI and styling of embedded ThoughtSpot.

The aspects you can control are:

1. Large component elements
2. CSS styles
3. Text string and image replacement
4. Menu items


== 01 - Getting started

This tutorial will use the Visual Embed SDK Playground built into every ThoughtSpot instance to give a live environment for trying the various customizations.

We suggest copying the code into a text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code to make it easier to work on the examples, then copy the values back into the code editor within the Playground.

We'll start by selecting a LiveboardEmbed component from the dropdown on the left:

Pick the "(Sample) Sales Performance" Liveboard, which should be available on any instance (including the Free Trial):

You should see code in the panel below the selector boxes, which you can copy at any point down to `.render();` :

[,javascript]
----
// Import ThoughtSpot SDK
import {
  init,
  LiveboardEmbed,
  Action,
  RuntimeFilterOp,
  EmbedEvent,
  AuthType,
  HostEvent
} from "@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk";
import "./styles.css";
import { getTokenService } from "./tokenService";
  
// Use prefetch to load static resources early and optimize response time. 
// Call init early to complete authentication during app load for better performance.
init({
  thoughtSpotHost:
    /*param-start-hosturl*/"https://embed-1-do-not-delete.thoughtspotstaging.cloud"/*param-end-hosturl*/,
/*param-start-styleCustomization*//*param-end-styleCustomization*/
  authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless,
  getAuthToken: getTokenService,
  disableTokenVerification: true,
});

// Instantiate class for embedding a Liveboard
const embed = new LiveboardEmbed("#your-own-div", {
    frameParams: {},
    /*param-start-liveboardId*/
     liveboardId: "d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a",
/*param-end-liveboardId*/
/*param-start-activeTabId*//*param-end-activeTabId*/
/*param-start-liveboardFullHeight*//*param-end-liveboardFullHeight*/
/*param-start-customizeLiveboardHeader*//*param-end-customizeLiveboardHeader*/
/*param-start-hideLiveboardHeader*//*param-end-hideLiveboardHeader*/
/*param-start-runtimeFiltersAndParameters*//*param-end-runtimeFiltersAndParameters*/
/*param-start-modifyActions*//*param-end-modifyActions*/
});

hideNoDataImage();
showErrorBanner('none');

embed
    // Register event listeners
    .on(EmbedEvent.Init, showLoader)
    .on(EmbedEvent.Load, hideLoader)
    /*param-start-customActionHandle*//*param-end-customActionHandle*/
    .on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
        if(error?.data?.errorType === 'FULLSCREEN') {
          showErrorBanner('none');
        } else 
        if(typeof(error.error) === 'string') {
          showErrorBanner('flex', error.error);
        } else {
          showErrorBanner('flex');
        }
        console.log('Error ', error);
        hideLoader();
    })
    // Render Liveboard
    .render();
----

== 02 - Large component elements

The checkboxes above the code panel provide quick access to the code to do many elements.

Click the checkbox for `Customize Liveboard header` and the following code block will appear:

[,javascript]
----
 /* Show or hide the liveboard title and description */
 showLiveboardTitle: true,
 showLiveboardDescription: true,
 // isLiveboardHeaderSticky: false, /* Removes the header stickiness when scrolling if set to false */
 // hideLiveboardHeader: true, /* Hides the entire liveboard header */

 /* Customize display of tabs in the liveboard header */
 // hideTabPanel: true, /* Removes the tab panel */
 // visibleTabs:['TabId'], /* Remove all tabs if empty array*/
 // hiddenTabs:['TabId'],
 /* Use either visibleTabs or hiddenTabs */
----

Note there are a number of examples that are commented out using the `//` line comment. You can remove any of these to enable and try the results.

Press the `Run` button to see the LiveboardEmbed component load to the left with the new options.

Now uncomment `hideLiveboardHeader: true` by removing the `//` in front.

Press the `Run` button again to see the updated results.

=== Available component element configurations
There are many more configurations available for each component than are easily chosen within the Playground.

To see all of the available options, you'll need to look at the `Visual Embed SDK Reference`, at the `{Component}ViewConfig` documentation under `Embed components`:

image:images/tutorials/style-customization/embed-components-reference.png[Components reference]

If we wanted to use something that is not part automatically generated by the Playground, simply go to its link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_LiveboardViewConfig[definition within the reference page^] and look at the example code.

Click on *link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_LiveboardViewConfig#_locale[locale^]*, which allows you to override any of the user's locale settings.

Copy the property into the code in the Playground and chose a valid locale code ('fr' or 'it' will work):

[,javascript]
----
 /* We added this one ourselves */
 locale: 'fr',
 /* Show or hide the liveboard title and description */
 showLiveboardTitle: true,
 showLiveboardDescription: true,
 // isLiveboardHeaderSticky: false, /* Removes the header stickiness when scrolling if set to false */
 // hideLiveboardHeader: true, /* Hides the entire liveboard header */

 /* Customize display of tabs in the liveboard header */
 // hideTabPanel: true, /* Removes the tab panel */
 // visibleTabs:['TabId'], /* Remove all tabs if empty array*/
 // hiddenTabs:['TabId'],
 /* Use either visibleTabs or hiddenTabs */
----

Press the `Run` button and try some of the menu system once the Liveboard has loaded up:

=== Hiding elements without configuration options
If there are elements of the page that you can't find an option to hide in the configruation options, you may need to use the CSS customization framework to hide a given element directly. 

This will be covered in the CSS styles portion of the tutorial. If you find you need to do this, please let ThoughtSpot know what element you would like to have a configuration option for.

== 03 - CSS styles
The Visual Embed SDK has a `customizations` framework for adding CSS and other overrides.

In the Playground, click the checkbox next to `Apply custom styles`.

[NOTE]
====
The `customizations` section goes in the `init()` function options object, whereas almost all other customizations happen in the component initializer.
====

A large block of code is generated, showing the variety of ways you can specify CSS customizations:

[,javascript]
----
customizations: {
  style: {
    customCSSUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/css-variables.css", // location of your style sheet

    // To apply overrides for your style sheet in this init, provide variable values below, eg
    customCSS: {
      variables: {
        "--ts-var-button--secondary-background": "#F0EBFF",
        "--ts-var-button--secondary--hover-background": "#E3D9FC",
        "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
      },
    },
  },
},
----

=== Variables and selectors

=== CSS files

=== Fonts

=== Hiding elements

== 04 - Text strings and image replacement


== 05 - Menu items
ThoughtSpot menus are accesible in the top right corner with the *...* icon or via a right-click on an axis or data point.

On a Liveboard, there is a liveboard level top menu as well as individual viz level top menus.

The menu from right-clicking a data point is referred to as the *Context Menu*. 

=== Hiding or disabling items
Individual menu items are controlled by their capabilities, which are referred to as *Actions*. 

The Visual Embed SDK reference guide for link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_Action[Actions^] contains the complete list of named capabilities. 

In the Playground, click the checkbox for `Modify available actions`, and the following code will be added automatically:

[,javascript]
----
disabledActions: [],
disabledActionReason: "Reason for disabling",
// visibleActions: [], /* Removes all actions if empty array */
hiddenActions: [],
/* Use either visibleActions or hiddenActions */
----

If we only want to show a small set of menu items, we can uncomment `visibleActions` (an allow list) and comment out `hiddenActions` (a deny list).

Let's only show the `DownloadAsPdf` Action:

[,javascript]
----
disabledActions: [],
disabledActionReason: "Reason for disabling",
visibleActions: [Action.DownloadAsPdf], /* Removes all actions if empty array */
//hiddenActions: [],
/* Use either visibleActions or hiddenActions */
----

When you press `Run`, the top level Liveboard menu will reload with only the single menu item specified in the `visibleActions` array.

[NOTE]
====
There is no longer a right-click *context menu* in the above example, because all of the *Actions* that would appear there (such as `Action.DrillDown`) are also hidden.
====

The `disabledActions` array keeps the item in the menu but grays it out, with the `disabledActionReason` appearing when hovering over the menu item.

=== Triggering hidden menu items with HostEvents

=== Adding new menu items with Custom Actions
