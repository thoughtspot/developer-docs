:page-description:  This is a self-guided course on style customization of the Visual Embed SDK components


One of the main advantages of ThoughtSpot Embedded is the control over the styling and UI elements provided by the Visual Embed SDK.

This tutorial provides a walkthrough of customizable elements of ThoughtSpot UI and essential steps to style your embedded ThoughtSpot content.

ThoughtSpot allows customizing the following aspects of its UI:

1. Large component elements
2. CSS styles
3. Text strings and icon replacement
4. Menu items


== 01 - Getting started

This tutorial uses the Visual Embed SDK Playground built into every ThoughtSpot instance to demonstrate various customizations in a live environment.

We suggest copying the code into a text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code to make it easier to work on the examples, and then copy the values back into the code editor within the Playground.

To get started:

. Select the `Liveboard` component to embed in the Playground:
+
[.widthAuto]
[.bordered]
image:images/tutorials/style-customization/choose-liveboard-embed.png[Choose LiveboardEmbed component]
. Select the *(Sample) Sales Performance* Liveboard, which should be available on all instances, including the Free Trial setup.
+
[.widthAuto]
[.bordered]
image:images/tutorials/style-customization/choose-liveboard.png[Choose Liveboard]

. If you do not have "(Sample) Sales Performance" available, use any Liveboard that you have access to.
+
You should see the following code in the code panel of the Playground page.

. Copy at any point down to `.render();`:
+
[source,javascript]
----
// Import ThoughtSpot SDK
import {
    init,
    LiveboardEmbed,
    Action,
    RuntimeFilterOp,
    EmbedEvent,
    AuthType,
    HostEvent
} from "@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk";
import "./styles.css";
import {
    getTokenService
} from "./tokenService";

// Use prefetch to load static resources early and optimize response time.
// Call init early to complete authentication during app load for better performance.
init({
   thoughtSpotHost:
   /*param-start-hosturl*/"https://embed-1-do-not-delete.thoughtspotstaging.cloud" /*param-end-hosturl*/
   /*param-start-styleCustomization*//*param-end-styleCustomization*/
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless,
    getAuthToken: getTokenService,
    disableTokenVerification: true,
});

// Instantiate class for embedding a Liveboard
const embed = new LiveboardEmbed("#your-own-div", {
    frameParams: {},
    /*param-start-liveboardId*/liveboardId: "d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a" /*param-end-liveboardId*/
    /*param-start-activeTabId*//*param-end-activeTabId*/
    /*param-start-liveboardFullHeight*//*param-end-liveboardFullHeight*/
    /*param-start-customizeLiveboardHeader*//*param-end-customizeLiveboardHeader*/
    /*param-start-hideLiveboardHeader*//*param-end-hideLiveboardHeader*/
    /*param-start-runtimeFiltersAndParameters*//*param-end-runtimeFiltersAndParameters*/
    /*param-start-modifyActions*//*param-end-modifyActions*/
});

hideNoDataImage();
showErrorBanner('none');

embed
    // Register event listeners
    .on(EmbedEvent.Init, showLoader)
    .on(EmbedEvent.Load, hideLoader)
    /*param-start-customActionHandle*//*param-end-customActionHandle*/
    .on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
        if (error?.data?.errorType === 'FULLSCREEN') {
            showErrorBanner('none');
        } else
        if (typeof(error.error) === 'string') {
            showErrorBanner('flex', error.error);
        } else {
            showErrorBanner('flex');
        }
        console.log('Error ', error);
        hideLoader();
    })
    // Render Liveboard
    .render();
----

== 02 - Large component elements

The checkboxes above the code panel provide quick access to the code to customize embedded elements.

. Click *Customize Liveboard header* checkbox. You'll see the following code block in the code editor:
+
[source,javascript]
----
 /* Show or hide the liveboard title and description */
 showLiveboardTitle: true,
 showLiveboardDescription: true,
 // isLiveboardHeaderSticky: false, /* Removes the header stickiness when scrolling if set to false */
 // hideLiveboardHeader: true, /* Hides the entire liveboard header */

 /* Customize display of tabs in the liveboard header */
 // hideTabPanel: true, /* Removes the tab panel */
 // visibleTabs:['TabId'], /* Remove all tabs if empty array*/
 // hiddenTabs:['TabId'],
 /* Use either visibleTabs or hiddenTabs */
----

+
[NOTE]
====
The code includes examples of several settings that are commented out using the `//` line comment.  Removing `//` enables these settings and allows you to include them in your code.
====

. Click *Run*. The `LiveboardEmbed` component loads with the new options.
. Remove `//` before the `hideLiveboardHeader: true` property to enable this setting.
. Click *Run* again to see the updated results.

=== Available options for component element customization
There are many more configurations available for each component than those available in the Playground. To see all available options, see link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/VisualEmbedSdk#_interfaces[Embed Classes^] and link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/VisualEmbedSdk#_interfaces[Embed Interfaces^].


[.bordered]
image:images/tutorials/style-customization/embed-components-reference.png[Components reference]

To use a setting that is not automatically generated by the Playground, go to its link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_LiveboardViewConfig[definition within the reference page^] and look at the example code.

To override user's locale settings:

. Click link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_LiveboardViewConfig#_locale[locale^].
. Copy the property into the code in the Playground and specify a valid locale attribute. For example, `fr` or `it`:
+
[source,javascript]
----
 /* We added this one ourselves */
 locale: 'fr',
 /* Show or hide the Liveboard title and description */
 showLiveboardTitle: true,
 showLiveboardDescription: true,
 // isLiveboardHeaderSticky: false, /* Removes the header stickiness when scrolling if set to false */
 // hideLiveboardHeader: true, /* Hides the entire liveboard header */

 /* Customize display of tabs in the liveboard header */
 // hideTabPanel: true, /* Removes the tab panel */
 // visibleTabs:['TabId'], /* Remove all tabs if empty array*/
 // hiddenTabs:['TabId'],
 /* Use either visibleTabs or hiddenTabs */
----

. Click *Run* and try some of the items in the menu system when the Liveboard loads.
+

=== Hiding elements without configuration options
If there are elements of the page that you can't find an option to hide in the embedded interface configuration options, you may need to xref:_hide_elements[use the CSS customization framework to hide a given element] directly.

If your implementation requires hiding certain elements, let ThoughtSpot know the element for which you need a configuration option by submitting an idea to the link:https://community.thoughtspot.com/s/ideas[ThoughtSpot Community^].

== 03 - CSS styles
The Visual Embed SDK has a `customizations` framework for adding CSS and other overrides.

In the Playground, select the *Apply custom styles* checkbox. The code panel shows a large block of code with various options for CSS customization:

[NOTE]
====
The `customizations` code goes in the `init()` function, whereas the other customizations are applied when the embedded component initializes.
====

[source,javascript]
----
customizations: {
    style: {
        customCSSUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/css-variables.css", // location of your style sheet

        // To apply overrides for your style sheet in this init, provide variable values below, eg
        customCSS: {
            variables: {
                "--ts-var-button--secondary-background": "#F0EBFF",
                "--ts-var-button--secondary--hover-background": "#E3D9FC",
                "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
            },
        },
    },
},
----

=== Variables and selectors
ThoughtSpot provides many pre-defined xref:customize-css-styles.adoc[CSS variables] to control the styling of the embedded component UI and its elements.

The style definitions can all be declared directly within the `variables` block of the `customCSS` code.

The customization framework also allows using any CSS selector to target specific elements with changes that do not have a defined variable. Selectors can be declared within the `rules_UNSTABLE` block inside `customCSS`. However, selectors may change with new releases as elements of ThoughtSpot are updated.

Let's add a selector to the code in our Playground. First, comment out the `customCSSUrl` line, then add the `rules_UNSTABLE` block below `variables`:

[source,javascript]
----
customizations: {
    style: {
        // customCSSUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/css-variables.css", // location of your style sheet

        // To apply overrides for your style sheet in this init, provide variable values below, eg
        customCSS: {
            variables: {
                "--ts-var-button--secondary-background": "#F0EBFF",
                "--ts-var-button--secondary--hover-background": "#E3D9FC",
                "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
            },
            rules_UNSTABLE: {

            }
        },
    },
},
----

Variables declare a __single__ property, therefore are defined as `"{var-name}" : "{value}"`, whereas selectors allow you to assign several properties to the selected elements.

[NOTE]
====
Selectors apply properties to elements with many layers of styling. Always add `!important` after each property to ensure the browser overrides whatever other style rules may be applied for the same property.
====

One use case of the `rules_UNSTABLE` section is `xref:css-customization.adoc#font-declarations[@font-face]` declarations, which have many properties for one selector.

We'll switch the main font to link:https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins[Poppins^], available from Google Fonts:

. Add the `--ts-var-root-font-family` variable to declare the new font. +
Note that you'll need to use this exact name value in `@font-face` declarations.
. Add a selector block within the `rules_UNSTABLE` block.
. Include xref:css-customization.adoc#_font_declarations[font declarations].
+
[source,javascript]
----
// ...
 customCSS: {
     variables: {
         "--ts-var-button--secondary-background": "#F0EBFF",
         "--ts-var-button--secondary--hover-background": "#E3D9FC",
         "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
         "--ts-var-root-font-family": "Poppins"
     },
     rules_UNSTABLE: {
         '/* ff-400 */ @font-face': {
             'font-family': "Poppins",
             'font-style': 'normal',
             'font-weight': '400',
             'font-display': 'swap',
             'src': "url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/poppins/v21/pxiEyp8kv8JHgFVrJJfecnFHGPc.woff2) format('woff2')"
         }
     }
 },
----
+
Notice the format shows the selector as the __key__, then an object block containing individual key-value pairs for the properties. Because the selector is an object key, but all `@font-face` declarations start the same way, we add a unique CSS comment at the beginning to allow for multiple `@font-face` declarations.

. Click *Run*.
. Notice the Liveboard reload with the `Poppins` font for most of the text.

=== CSS files
You can collect a set of variables and selectors into a CSS file, rather than declaring them in the JavaScript code block.
CSS files can be included from any domain, but they must be added to the *CSP style-src domains* and *CSP font-src* domains on the *Develop* > *Customizations* -> *Security settings* page.

Both `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` and `https://fonts.gstatic.com` sites are automatically added to ThoughtSpot's CSP allowlist.

In your CSS file, the global variables must be declared in the `:root { }` block, while `@font-face` declarations of a named font can be placed anywhere:

[,css]
----
:root {
  --ts-var-button--primary-background: #2359B6;
  --ts-var-button--primary--hover-background: blue;
  --ts-var-button--primary--font-family: Poppins,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Poppins';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/poppins/v21/pxiEyp8kv8JHgFVrJJfecnFHGPc.woff2) format('woff2');
}

.bk-filter-option {
  display: none!important;
}
----

=== Hide elements
As seen in the CSS file example above, one of the use cases for selectors is to hide embed component elements that do not have a configuration option.

`display: none!important` is the most typical property to accomplish this, but you may choose any CSS rule that causes the desired effect.

Make sure that the selector you use is specific and does not affect other elements that you don't intend to hide.

If you have been hiding certain elements via CSS selectors, link:https://community.thoughtspot.com/s/ideas[contact ThoughtSpot^] to request configuration options for such elements, so that the overall configurations can be expanded over time. Similarly, provide feedback on properties that variables are unavailable by submitting an idea to the link:https://community.thoughtspot.com/s/ideas[ThoughtSpot Community^].

== 04 - Text strings and icon replacement
The `customizations` object allows replacing replace specific xref:customize-text-strings.adoc[text strings] and xref:customize-icons.adoc[icons].

=== Replace text strings

Let's add the `content` property above the `style` property in the `customizations` code and then add  the  `strings` property block within this code. Now we can declare the exact text elements to replace within ThoughtSpot:

[source,javascript]
----
// ...
customizations: {
    content: {
        strings: {
            "Liveboard": "Dashboard",
            "SpotIQ": "Insights",
            "Spotter": "AI Agent"
        }
    },
    style: {
        ...
    },
},
----

=== Replace icon sprites

Icon sprite replacement requires creating a file of SVG icon definitions, the format for which is available in the xref:customize-icons.adoc[icon sprite customization documentation]. After you have the SVG file saved and accessible to ThoughtSpot, add the `iconSpriteUrl` property in the `customizations` block:

[source,javascript]
----
// ...
customizations: {
    iconSpriteUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/icon-override1.svg",
    content: {
        strings: {
            "Liveboard": "Dashboard",
            "SpotIQ": "Insights",
            "Spotter": "AI Agent"
        }
    },
    style: {
        ...
    },
},
----

== 05 - Menu items
ThoughtSpot menus are accessible in the top right corner with the ellipsis icon (`...`) or via a right-click on a chart axis or data point. The `...` menu is referred to as the *More* options menu.

On Liveboards, a top menu for the Liveboard and a separate menu for each visualization is available. The menu from right-clicking a data point is referred to as the *Context menu*.

=== Hiding or disabling items
Individual menu items are controlled by their capabilities and are referred to as *Actions*. The Visual Embed SDK reference guide for link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_Action[Actions^] contains a complete list of named capabilities.

In the Playground, select the checkbox for `Modify available actions`. You'll see the following code in the code editor:

[source,javascript]
----
  disabledActions: [],
  disabledActionReason: "Reason for disabling",
  // visibleActions: [], /* Removes all actions if empty array */
  hiddenActions: [],
  /* Use either visibleActions or hiddenActions */
----

If you want to show only a small set of selected menu items, use `visibleActions` (an allowlist) and comment out `hiddenActions` (a deny list).

Let's show only the `DownloadAsPdf` action:

[source,javascript]
----
  disabledActions: [],
  disabledActionReason: "Reason for disabling",
  visibleActions: [Action.DownloadAsPdf], /* Removes all actions if empty array */
  //hiddenActions: [],
  /* Use either visibleActions or hiddenActions */
----

When you click *Run*, the Liveboard reloads with only a single menu item in the *More* options menu as specified in the `visibleActions` array.

[NOTE]
====
The above example also hides the right-click context menu items, including the *Drill down* action (`Action.DrillDown`).
====

The `disabledActions` array keeps the item in the menu but grays it out, and shows `disabledActionReason` when hovering over the disabled action.

=== Triggering hidden menu items with HostEvents
ThoughtSpot Visual Embed SDK defines two types of events:

* link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent[EmbedEvents^] - to listen to actions within ThoughtSpot components
* link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_HostEvent[HostEvents^] - to send messages to the ThoughtSpot components from the embedding application.

If a menu item has been hidden, you can still send in a *HostEvent* to cause the same behavior.

In the Playground, select the *Use Host Event* checkbox. You'll see the following code block in the code editor:

[source,javascript]
----
 document.getElementById('tryBtn').addEventListener('click', e => {
      // Trigger events can be added here to bind to try button click!
      // eg use the Reload Event so that clicking on "Try event" button reloads the embed:
      embed.trigger(HostEvent.Reload);
 });
----

The above code block adds a click event to the *Try Event* button above the preview panel in the Playground. Clicking *Try Event* triggers the `HostEvent`.

Let's replace the default `Reload` event with `DownloadAsPdf`:

[source,javascript]
----
 document.getElementById('tryBtn').addEventListener('click', e => {
     // Trigger events can be added here to bind to try button click!
     // eg use the Reload Event so that clicking on "Try event" button reloads the embed:
     embed.trigger(HostEvent.DownloadAsPdf);
 });
----

Testing this requires the following steps:

1. Click *Run* to reload the embedded component.
2. Click *Try Event*.

You should see the PDF export modal dialog button pop up within the embedded component area.

If you do not want the modal dialog to appear, you could instead use the ThoughtSpot REST API to accomplish the task either within the browser or in a back-end process. This allows for choosing vastly different behaviors than those allowed by the ThoughtSpot modal dialogs.

=== Adding new menu items with custom actions
ThoughtSpot allows you to add new items called *xref:custom-actions.adoc[custom actions]* to the menu system, either to the *More* options menu on a given visualization of a Liveboard or the context menu that appears when a single point is right-clicked.

The *Callback* custom actions require a three-part setup:

1. Define the custom action within ThoughtSpot, with a particular *id*.
2. Assign the custom action to the visualization.
3. Add the `EmbedEvent.CustomAction` listener within the Visual Embed SDK code.

To try it out, select the `Handle custom actions` checkbox. You'll see the following code block in the code editor:

[source,javascript]
----
 .on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, payload => {
     const customActionId = 'insert Custom Action ID here';
     if (payload.id === customActionId || payload.data.id === customActionId) {
         console.log('Custom Action event:', payload.data);
     }
 })
----

Some link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent[EmbedEvents^] such as `VizPointClick` fire off without involving the menu system and function similarly to context menu custom action.

== 06 - Conclusion

This tutorial has covered how to customize the UI and UX of ThoughtSpot's embedded components, but only within the Visual Embed SDK Playground.

The next steps are to move this code into your application page and configure the CSP and CORS settings for your application's test environments, so you begin integrating ThoughtSpot directly into your application.
