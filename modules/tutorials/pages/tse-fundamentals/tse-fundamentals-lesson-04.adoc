:page-description: This lesson guides you through reviewing and modifying the code, starting the web server, and testing the initial setup in a browser.

Now that we've got everything (hopefully) set up, it's time to dig into the code we'll be modifying. In this lesson, we'll create a copy of the code, take a look at the files, and then start the web server to make sure everything is working fine.

== Pre-Conditions

You should have completed the activities in the previous lessons. In particular:

* Download the GitHub source code in xref:tse-fundamentals-lesson-02.adoc.
* Have a ThoughtSpot account with Developer privileges.
* Have configured the security settings to enable embedding.

At this point, you'll need an editor such as an IDE or a text editor, ideally one that supports JavaScript and HTML formatting. The examples here use https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code], a popular, free IDE, but any editor that can edit text files will work.

== Make a copy of the code

You can work directly in the code you downloaded from GitHub, but it's usually better to create a copy, so you can always revert if needed (or you can just download again). The path you choose is entirely up to you.

Whichever approach you take, you should end up with a folder with the files shown below.

== Review the main files

We won't dive into all the files yet. The `apis` and `images` folders will be covered later in the course. The three main files for the application are `index.html`, `tse.css`, and `tse.js`.

=== index.html

This is a standard HTML page and will serve as the primary page for the application. We'll embed everything into the resulting document object model (DOM). This file is used only to define the content of the application. The layout and dynamic portions will be handled in the CSS and JS files.

Key sections of this file include:

The first section of interest is the div for showing navigation links. We'll add new links as we add functionality. These will be the only updates we make to the HTML file.

[source,html]
----
<div id="div-nav-links">
    <ul id="ul-nav-links">
    </ul>
</div>
----

Perhaps the most important section is the div with the `id="embed"`. This div tells the TSE SDK where to render content. The ID can be any value, but it must match the ID we use when embedding. `embed` is common but not required. Note that you can have more than one section for embedding.

[source,html]
----
<div id='embed'>
    <p>This content will be replaced by your embedded content.</p>
</div>
----

Lastly, we import the `tse.js` file as a JavaScript module. We're using the ES6 version of JavaScript, which supports modules. This version is supported in all modern browsers.

[source,html]
----
<script src='tse.js' type='module'></script>
----

=== tse.css

The CSS file controls the look, feel, and layout of the application. We'll also use style modifications to show and hide items. We won't be modifying the CSS file as part of this project, but it's worth looking at the definitions, especially the `#embed` class.

=== tse.js

The final file to review is `tse.js`, which contains the application logic. Initially, this file is sparse, but we'll add functionality as we go.

The first section imports some components from the SDK. The `.es.js` at the end indicates it's the version for ES6. There’s also a plain vanilla version without the `.es` and an npm package for installation.

[source,javascript]
----
import {
  init,
  AuthType,
} from 'https://unpkg.com/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

Next, we define the `tsURL` to indicate the server you're connecting to. It’s not technically required, but it avoids hard coding the value multiple times. You should change this to reflect the ThoughtSpot server you are using.

[source,javascript]
----
const tsURL = "https://myx.thoughtspot.cloud";
----

Finally, the `loadApp` function will be called when the window is loaded (see the last line of the file). This is where we’ll put the initialization code for the application.

== Start the Web Server

After reviewing the relevant files, it's time to start the web server to ensure everything works. You can use any web server, but in this course, we'll use the Live Server extension described in xref:tse-fundamentals-lesson-02.adoc.

You can start Live Server by clicking the image::images/tutorials/tse-fundamentals/lesson-04-start-live-server.png[start live server] button. Once it starts, the button will change to image::images/tutorials/tse-fundamentals/lesson-04-live-server-running.png[live server running].

== View the page in the browser

Now, let's confirm the page loads. Typically, Live Server will automatically open the browser. If not, open your web browser (examples are in Chrome) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see something like the image below.

== Open dev tools and disable the cache

Next, open the developer tools in your browser. In Chrome, go to the menu: View -> Developer -> Developer Tools. You can also use shortcuts for different operating systems.

image::images/tutorials/tse-fundamentals/lesson-04-open-dev-tools.png[Open developer tools]

You should see a panel like the following, though it may open in a different tab. For me, it opened in the Console view, where you can see errors, warnings, and general info messages.

image::images/tutorials/tse-fundamentals/lesson-04-dev-tools-console.png[Developer tools console, scale=50%]

Now, go to the Network tab and check the `Disable cache` box. Failure to do this may cause your code updates not to appear. Keep the developer tool window open, but you can make it smaller or move it as needed.

At this point, you're ready to start adding content.

== Activities

1. Make a copy of the code in a new folder where you will do your work.
2. Modify the `tsURL` value to the URL for your ThoughtSpot instance.
3. Start the web server.
4. Open the application in a browser.
5. Open the developer tools and disable the cache.
