:page-title: Embed a Liveboard
:page-pageid: tse-fundamentals__lesson-07 
:page-description: In this lesson we'll embed a full Liveboard using the `LiveboardEmbed` component.

== Pre-conditions

It's ideal if you've done all the lessons so far. Ensure that you have set up the environment and code, and have the `init` method working as described in xref:tse-fundamentals-lesson-05.adoc[lesson 05].

== Add a nav link and function for the Liveboard embed

First, we want to add another nav link to the nav bar. In the `index.html` file add a new `<li>` for the separator and the Liveboard.

[source,html]
----
<div id="div-nav-links">
    <ul id="ul-nav-links">
        <li id="search-link">Search</li> <!-- lesson 05 -->
        <li>|</li>
        <li id="spotter-link">Natural Language Conversation</li>  <!-- lesson 06 -->
        <li>|</li>
        <li id="Liveboard-link">Liveboard</li>  <!-- lesson 07 -->
    </ul>
</div>
----

Now run the application, and you should see the new links. It doesn't do anything yet, but it's always good to test code as we add functionality to find errors quickly. The UI could use some style work to make it easier to read, but this layout is sufficient to learn ThoughtSpot Embedded.

== Add a listener for the Liveboard links

In `tse.js` add the following lines of code. It adds a listener for the click events, so when the user clicks, it will call the `onLiveboard` function. Add the following line after the one we added for the `spotter-link`.

[source,javascript]
----
document.getElementById('liveboard-link').addEventListener('click', onLiveboard);
----

Add the functions to get called. After the close of the `onSearch` function, add the following functions. You will see a comment in the console, but it will tell you that the function is being called.

[source,javascript]
----
const onLiveboard = () => {
  console.log('liveboard clicked');
}
----

Refresh the application and click on the new link. You should see a message in the console window of the developer tools.

== Add the LiveboardEmbed to the import

To use the `LiveboardEmbed` component, we need to import it. At the top of the file, add `LiveboardEmbed` to the list of components. You should now have an import like the following:

[source,javascript]
----
import {
  init,
  AuthType,
  SearchEmbed,
  LiveboardEmbed,
  Action,
} from 'https://unpkg.com/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Generate a Liveboard to embed

The same way you created a `SearchEmbed` component in the playground, we'll create a Liveboard embed. Navigate to the Visual Embed SDK playground and select `Liveboard` from the dropdown on the top left. You should see the page shown in the following figure. While search will show Search page, the Liveboard doesn't have a default view.

The `LiveboardEmbed` has fewer options than `SearchEmbed`. For the Liveboard, you need to pick a specific Liveboard from the dropdown. Then, you can specify a tab in the Liveboard to start on if desired. You can also try the following Liveboard-specific options:

* Full height +
When set, this feature will cause the header to scroll up and down.
* Set runtime filters +
You can set (and update) runtime filters on the Liveboard without a user selecting them

Let's create the Liveboard component to embed. In this case, you just need to specify a Liveboard from the dropdown. We'll just use the defaults for the other values.

. Select a Liveboard from the dropdown +
You should see a `liveboardId` added to the code.
. Click *Run* +
The Liveboard shows up on the preview panel.

== Embed the Liveboard into the application

As with Search and Natural Language Conversation embedding, we'll copy the code from the playground into the application.

. Copy the component creation section. Your code will show as follows.
. Paste this code into the `onLiveboard` function.
+
[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new LiveboardEmbed("#embed", {
    frameParams: {},
    liveboardId: "0dc92611-2643-4c3e-a7c3-e7e421af9fd1",
});
----
. Render the component. Failure to add this step results in an empty embed area.

[source,javascript]
----
embed.render();
----

The completed `onLiveboard` code will be as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
const onLiveboard = () => {
  const embed = new LiveboardEmbed("#embed", {
    frameParams: {},
    liveboardId: "0dc92611-2643-4c3e-a7c3-e7e421af9fd1",
  });

  embed.render();
}
----

== Test the Liveboard embed

The last step is to test the embedded Liveboard. Simply refresh the application (with cache disabled), then click the `Liveboard` link, and you should get something like the following:

== Activities

1. Add the nav link and handler to your code
2. Import the `LiveboardEmbed` component
3. Use the playground to create the embed Liveboard component
4. Copy and paste the generated code (adding `render()`) into your application
5. Test the code

If you run into problems, you can look at the code in the `src` folder in this section.
