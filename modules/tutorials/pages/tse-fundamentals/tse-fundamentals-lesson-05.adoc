:page-pageid: tse-fundamentals__lesson-05
:page-description: This lesson covers initializing the SDK and embedding a ThoughtSpot search page using the developer's playground to generate the required code.

At this point, we are ready to start embedding ThoughtSpot content.
In this lesson, we'll initialize the SDK and embed a search page.
To make it quick and easy, we'll use the developer's playground to generate the code, then update our HTML and JS files to use the generated code.
This is the longest lesson in the tutorial, but once you complete it, you'll understand how to embed other objects.

== Pre-conditions

If you've followed the steps in the previous sections, you should have a copy of the code and be able to run it and view the empty application in a web browser.
If not, please revisit the previous lessons to get set up.

== Add a nav link and function for the search

First, add a nav link to run the search embed.
In the `index.html` file, add a new `<li>` for the search page.
The link needs an ID to add a listener.

[source,html]
----
<div id="div-nav-links">
  <ul id="ul-nav-links">
    <li id="search-link">Search</li>  <!-- lesson 05 -->
  </ul>
</div>
----

Now, run the application, and you should see the Search link show up.
It won't do anything yet, but it's always good to test code as you add functionality to find errors quickly.

== Add a listener for the search link

In `tse.js`, add the following line of code.
It adds a listener for the click event, so when the user clicks, it will call the `onSearch` function.
Put this code in the section that begins with `Events for nav bar` towards the bottom of the file.

`document.getElementById('search-link').addEventListener('click', onSearch);`

Next, add the `onSearch` function.
Right now, it only logs a comment to the console, but this confirms the function is being called.

[source,javascript]
----
const onSearch = () => {
  console.log('searching');
}
----

Refresh the application and click on the Search link.
You should see a message in the console window of the developer tools.
If not, check for errors.
You can also reference the example code (in the `src` folder).

== Call init

Before embedding the search, we need to initialize the SDK.
Initializing the SDK tells it which ThoughtSpot instance to communicate with and the type of authentication.
There are additional parameters you can pass, which you can read about in the link:https://developer-docs-nnh3ibjh0-thoughtspot-site.vercel.app/docs/tsembed#initSdk[documentation].

One useful parameter to consider is `callPrefetch`, which can speed up the first embed object's load time by caching static content locally.
This will not have an effect if caching is disabled during development but can improve performance in production.

For a basic `init` call, add the following code to the `loadApp` function.
We also set the embed to display a message asking the user to select an option.
The variable `tsURL` refers to the constant defined earlier, for example, `const tsURL = "https://myx.thoughtspot.cloud";`.

The final version of `loadApp` should look like this:

[source,javascript]
----
const loadApp = () => {
  init({
    thoughtSpotHost: tsURL,
    authType: AuthType.None
  });

  document.getElementById("embed").innerHTML = "<p>Select an option from above.</p>";
}
----

== Generate a search to embed

To simplify the process of creating an embed, use the developer's Playground.
To access the Playground:

* Log into ThoughtSpot as a developer.
* Click on the **Develop** tab at the top of the screen.
* Select the **Playground** option under Visual Embed SDK on the left.

You'll see a screen like the following, though with default values.
We'll set the values to create a search embed component.

The Playground is divided into three sections:

* On the right: the running embed, showing how the embedded content will look.
* On the top left: options for selecting components and their properties, starting with **Search Data**.
* On the bottom left: the actual code for the embed component, which updates automatically as you make changes.

Follow these steps to create the search component we want to embed:

1. Select a data source from the dropdown.
The code will update with the GUID for the data source.
The Playground only supports one data source at a time.

2. Click on **Collapse data panel** to collapse the data panel in the embed.
3. Click on **Add search tokens**.
This adds code for search options.
The `searchTokenString` uses a TML query.
Here's an example:

[source,javascript]
----
searchOptions: {
  searchTokenString: '[sales] by [item type]', // Example TML query
  executeSearch: true,
},
----

4. Modify available actions.
You can disable, hide, or specify which actions are visible in the menu.
Here's an example of disabling the download action and hiding the share action:

[source,javascript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.Download],
disabledActionReason: "Permission required",
hiddenActions: [Action.Share],
----

Hit **Run** to see the results.
If needed, adjust the settings.

== Embed the search into the application

Once the embed component is ready, we can add it to the `onSearch` function.
Every embed component requires two steps:

1. Create the embed object using `SearchEmbed`, `LiveboardEmbed`, etc.
2. Render the object (with optional event listeners).

Copy the generated code from the Playground into the `onSearch` function after the `console.log` statement.
Be sure to change the ID from `#your-own-div` to `#embed` to match the `index.html` file.  Note that all IDs will
be unique to your environment.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new SearchEmbed("#embed", {
    frameParams: {},
    collapseDataSources: true,
    disabledActions: [Action.Download],
    disabledActionReason: "Permission required",
    hiddenActions: [Action.Share],
    dataSources: ["4d98d3f5-5c6a-44eb-82fb-d529ca20e31f"], // Your data source ID
    searchOptions: {
        searchTokenString: '[sales] [item type]',
        executeSearch: true,
    },
});
----

Next, render the component using this line of code:

`embed.render();`

The completed `onSearch` function should look like this:

[source,javascript]
----
const onSearch = () => {
  const embed = new SearchEmbed("#embed", {
    frameParams: {},
    collapseDataSources: true,
    disabledActions: [Action.Download],
    disabledActionReason: "Permission required",
    hiddenActions: [Action.Share],
    dataSources: ["4d98d3f5-5c6a-44eb-82fb-d529ca20e31f"], // Your data source ID
    searchOptions: {
      searchTokenString: "[sales] [item type]",
      executeSearch: true,
    },
  });

  embed.render();
};
----

== Test search embed

To test the search embed, refresh the application with the cache disabled, then click the Search link.
You should see something similar to this:

== Note on loading times

The initial render may take a long time as the content is re-downloaded from ThoughtSpot.
This can be significantly improved by using `callPrefetch: true` in the `init` method.
However, with caching disabled during development, re-downloading will still occur.

== Activities

1. Add the nav link and handler to your code.
2. Import the `SearchEmbed`, `Action`, and `EmbedEvent` components in the import section.
3. Add the `init` method.
4. Use the Playground to create a search embed component.
5. Copy the search embed component into your code and modify the `DIV` ID.
6. Add a `render()` call.
7. Test the code.

If you run into issues, you can reference the code in the `src` folder.
