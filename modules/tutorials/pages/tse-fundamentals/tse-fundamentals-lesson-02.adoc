:page-pageid: tse-fundamentals_lesson-02
:page-description: This lesson goes through the requirements to get set up for the course, including prerequisites, TSE documentation, Developer's Playground, and downloading starter code.

In this lesson we'll go through the requirements to get set up for the course. By the end, you should be in a position to do all the lessons and exercises. Specific topics include:

* The pre-conditions that need to be satisfied.
* Reviewing the ThoughtSpot Embedded documentation.
* Gaining familiarity with the Developer's Playground.
* Downloading the starter code.

== Pre-conditions

You should also have a ThoughtSpot developer account with ThoughtSpot Embedded enabled. If you don't already have an account, you can create a https://www.thoughtspot.com/trial?tsref=ts-dev-training[trial account] that's good for 14 days and has ThoughtSpot Embedded enabled.

You will also need the following:

* A modern web browser. We'll use Chrome in the examples, but you should be able to use other browsers like Firefox or Safari.  *_NOTE: this class will use a cookie-based session, so you need to enable 3rd party cookies / cross-site tracking, which some browsers disable by default._*
* A text editor for editing code. You can use any text editor, but an IDE that supports HTML, CSS, and Javascript will work better. The examples in this course use Visual Studio Code, a popular IDE for web development.
* A web server to run the code. We'll be running a very basic web application, so you don't need a complex web server. This course will use https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer[Live Server] which is available in the Visual Studio Marketplace. With this installed, you can start and stop the server with a single click.

== Review the ThoughtSpot Embedded documentation

ThoughtSpot provides detailed documentation about embedding and the SDK. There are two places you can get the documentation. First, you can use the documentation from the developer documentation site: https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs[https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs]

The second location is in the ThoughtSpot Develop tab. The image below shows the links to the documentation for the Visual Embed SDK Guide and the REST API Guide.

== Become familiar with the playground

Click the Playground link in the "Develop" tab under "Visual Embed SDK" (see the image above) and you will open the Playground. The playground is an area that lets you quickly and easily generate working code that you can embed into your application. The following image shows an example using a natural language search embed.

The image above has three main sections:

1. The first section shows a preview of how your embedded analytics. As you make changes and run the code you get to see the results. This is what the code would look like in your application (ignoring any style differences). This is a great benefit to using the playground, because errors will also show up.
2. The second section allows you to choose different options. At the top is a dropdown that lets you specify the type of content you are embedding. The options below the dropdown differ based on the content selected.
3. The third and final section is the code that is being run. This code is interactive and can be modified and then run using the (Run) button. The code can be updated using the selections in section two or by modifying the code directly. The code section has smart code completion that can help enter the appropriate values.

== Download the code

Before beginning, you should download the code from https://github.com/thoughtspot/tse-step-by-step/[GitHub]. The recommended approach is to use the https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone[`git clone`] command to make a local copy, perhaps after https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo[forking] the code base. If you don't want to take this route (or don't know what those commands are), then you can also just download the code using the Download Zip option as shown in the image below.

`git clone https://github.com/thoughtspot/tse-step-by-step/`

== Activities

1. Explore the documentation site.
2. Log in as a Developer and explore the "Develop" tab. All users on the free trial have Developer privileges.
3. Open the Visual Embed SDK Playground, modify content and run the resulting code to become familiar with the code.
4. Download the code or clone the repository.
