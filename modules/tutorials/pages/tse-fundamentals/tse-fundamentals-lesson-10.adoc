:page-title: Lesson 10 - Styling Embedded ThoughtSpot Content
:page-pageid: tse-fundamentals_lesson10
:page-description: In this lesson, we'll explore how to style embedded ThoughtSpot content using the UI and custom CSS.

== Pre-Conditions

You need to be logged in as a developer or administrator in ThoughtSpot to view the style page.

== Changing style in the UI

If you navigate to the `Develop -> Styles` page in ThoughtSpot you will see a form similar to the following. It allows you to change a limited number of style options. Commonly changed style items are:

* Change the top left logo and favicon
* Change the color palette for charts
* Some limited font styles such as chart labels (but not other text like names and descriptions)
* Adding a footer for embedded text or changing the page title in the browser

Some of these changes should be well tested. For example, you can change the background color of the navigation menu to any color you want, but not the foreground color. So if you set it to a light color such as white or grey, users will have a hard time reading the text.

See the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/style-customization,[ThoughtSpot documentation] for more details about each setting.

== Using the customizations setting

The visual embed SDK allows you to set a custom style sheet or custom variables (or a combination of both). Full details can be found in the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_CustomisationsInterface[Developer Documentation].

The code fragment below is what's generated if you select the `Apply custom styles` option in any embed. Note that the customizations can be part of the init and apply to all embeds, or part of the individual embedded object if you only want to style one object.

[source,javascript]
----
customizations: {
  style: {
    customCSSUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/css-variables.css", // location of your style sheet

    // To apply overrides for your style sheet in this init, provide variable values below, eg
    customCSS: {
      variables: {
        "--ts-var-button--secondary-background": "#F0EBFF",
        "--ts-var-button--secondary--hover-background": "#E3D9FC",
        "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
      },
    },
  },
},
----

The `customCSSUrl` allows you to specify a path to a style sheet. The URL must have an entry in the security settings for the CSP-styles. The `customCSS` option allows you to specify individual variables instead of a style sheet. The link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/custom-css[Developers documentation] contains a list of all the current variables.

=== Creating and applying a style sheet

The link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/custom-css#_sample_css_file_with_variable_definitions[Developer documentation] provides an example style sheet that you can copy and modify to get started. Simply copy this into your own CSS file and modify as desired. Then you need to deploy to a location that ThoughtSpot can access and make sure the URL is enabled in the Developer -> Security settings.

The following code snippet shows an example of using a custom style sheet. This one is hosted in GitHub and uses jsdelivr as a CDN to host the file.

[source,javascript]
----
customizations: {
  style: {
    customCSSUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nrentz-ts/css/dark-theme.css", // location of your style sheet
  },
}
----

If you apply this style and refresh the page, you get the following:

=== Additional style options

The majority of the style is related to colors and fonts. The custom styles also support custom sprites, such as replacing the different icons in the UI. You can also modify text strings in the embedded content, such as renaming Liveboards to Dashboard. See the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/custom-css#_customize_text_strings[Developer documentation] for more details.

== Activities

1. Look at the different options on the style settings page.
2. Review the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/style-customization[Developer documentation] for style settings.
3. If you like, create and use a custom CSS style sheet.
