:page-pageid: tse-fundamentals__lesson-06
:page-description: This lesson demonstrates embedding a Natural Language Conversation (Spotter) component into the application using the same pattern as earlier lessons.

Now that you've embedded a search, you'll notice that the rest of the embedding follows the same basic pattern:

* Create the component in the Playground.
* Add the component to your code and render it.

In this lesson, we'll embed the ConversationEmbed components into the application.

== Pre-conditions

You should have already completed all the lessons through xref:tse-fundamentals-lesson-05.adoc[lesson 05].

== Add a nav link and function for the natural language conversation

First, add a nav link for the natural language conversation embed. In the `index.html` file, add a new `<li>` for the natural language conversation page. We'll also add a pipe character `|` as a separator in the menu. Your code should look like this:

[source,html]
----
<div id="div-nav-links">
    <ul id="ul-nav-links">
        <li id="search-link">Search</li> <!-- lesson 05 -->
        <li>|</li>
        <li id="spotter-link">Natural Language Conversation</li>  <!-- lesson 06 -->
    </ul>
</div>
----

Now run the application to verify everything is working. You should see the Search and Natural Language Conversation links in the menu.

== Add a listener for the search link

In `tse.js`, add the following line of code to register a listener for the click event. When clicked, it will call the `onSpotter` function. Place this after the listener added in the previous lesson. The event listener section should now have two listeners.

[source,javascript]
----
document.getElementById("search-link").addEventListener("click", onSearch);
document.getElementById("spotter-link").addEventListener("click", onSage);
----

Next, add the `onSpotter` function. Initially, this will just log a message to the console to confirm it's being triggered.

[source,javascript]
----
const onSpotter = () => {
  console.log('using natural language conversation');
}
----

Refresh the application and click the Natural Language link. You should see the console log message in the developer tools. If not, check for errors.

== Generate a natural language conversation to embed

If you're not already in the Visual SDK playground, navigate there and select **Spotter** from the dropdown menu. Then select a worksheet.  You should see an empty page with the bar as shown here:

Let's review the Spotter-specific settings and configure the embed.

* The `Select data source` dropdown is similar to what we used for the Search embed. It will display any worksheet the user has access to. Select one from the dropdown to update the code with the data source's GUID.

Now, set some additional options:

* **Add search query**: Allows you to add a starting query to use for the search.

For this exercise select **Add search query**. Enter a search query, then press **Run**. You should see a result like this:

== Embed the natural language conversation into the application

Now that we've created the conversation embed component using the playground, let's add it to the `onSpotter` function. Remember to update the `div` ID from `#your-own-div` to `#embed` to match the `index.html` file. Finally, add a call to `render()`.

Here is the resulting function with comments removed and the DIV ID updated:

[source,javascript]
----
const onSpotter = () => {
  const embed = new ConversationEmbed("#embed", {
    frameParams: {},
    worksheetId: "4d98d3f5-5c6a-44eb-82fb-d529ca20e31f",
    searchOptions: {
      searchQuery: "what are my top selling products in October",
    },
  });

  embed.render();
};
----

== Test natural language conversation embed

The final step is to test the conversation embed. Refresh the application (with cache disabled), then click the Natural Language Conversation link. You should see something like this:

== Activities

1. Add the nav link and handler to your code.
2. Import `ConversationEmbed`.
3. Use the playground to create a Spotter embed component.
4. Copy the embed component from the playground to your code and modify the DIV ID.
5. Add a `render()` call.
6. Test the code.

If you run into issues, you can reference the code in the `src` folder.
