:page-pageid: tse-fundamentals_lesson-06
:page-description: This lesson demonstrates embedding a Natural Language Search (Sage) component into the application using the same pattern as earlier lessons.
~~~

Now that you've embedded a search, you'll notice that the rest of the embedding follows the same basic pattern:
* Create the component in the playground.
* Add the component to your code and render it.

In this lesson, we'll embed Natural Language Search (also known as Sage) into the application. Sage is a newer feature introduced in version 9.8.

== Pre-Conditions

You should have already completed all the lessons through <<../lesson-05-embed-search/README-05.md,lesson 5>>.

== Add a nav link and function for the natural language search

First, add a nav link for the Sage embed. In the `index.html` file, add a new `<li>` for the natural language search page. We'll also add a pipe character `|` as a separator in the menu. Your code should look like this:

[source,html]
----
<div id="div-nav-links">
    <ul id="ul-nav-links">
        <li id="search-link">Search</li> <!-- lesson 05 -->
        <li>|</li>
        <li id="sage-link">Sage</li>  <!-- lesson 06 -->
    </ul>
</div>
----

Now run the application to verify everything is working. You should see the Search and Sage links in the menu.

== Add a listener for the search link

In `tse.js`, add the following line of code to register a listener for the click event. When clicked, it will call the `onSage` function. Place this after the listener added in the previous lesson. The event listener section should now have two listeners.

[source,javascript]
----
document.getElementById("search-link").addEventListener("click", onSearch);
document.getElementById("sage-link").addEventListener("click", onSage);
----

Next, add the `onSage` function. Initially, this will just log a message to the console to confirm it's being triggered.

[source,javascript]
----
const onSage = () => {
  console.log('using natural language search');
}
----

Refresh the application and click the Sage link. You should see the console log message in the developer tools. If not, check for errors.

== Generate a natural language search to embed

If you're not already in the Visual SDK playground, navigate there and select **Natural Language Search** from the dropdown menu. You should see an empty Sage search embed like this:

Let's review the Sage-specific settings and configure the embed.

* The `Select data source` dropdown is similar to what we used for the Search embed. It will display any worksheets enabled for natural language search. Select one from the dropdown to update the code with the data source's GUID.

Unlike the Search embed, you can only have one data source for Sage search, and a data source is always required for Sage search, though it can be user-provided.

Now, set some additional options:

* **Disable changing worksheet**: Prevents the user from changing the pre-selected data source.
* **Hide Sage Answer header**: Hides the "AI answer" header in the results.
* **Add search query**: Predefines a text query to run automatically, similar to the search embed.

For this exercise, select the options **Disable changing worksheet**, **Hide Sage Answer header**, and **Add search query**. Enter a search query, then press **Run**. You should see a result like this:

== Embed the natural language search into the application

Now that we've created the Sage embed component using the playground, let's add it to the `onSage` function. Remember to update the `div` ID from `#your-own-div` to `#embed` to match the `index.html` file. Finally, add a call to `render()`.

Here is the resulting function with comments removed and the DIV ID updated:

[source,javascript]
----
const onSage = () => {
  const embed = new SageEmbed("#embed", {
    frameParams: {},
    disableWorksheetChange: true,
    hideSageAnswerHeader: true,
    dataSource: "4d98d3f5-5c6a-44eb-82fb-d529ca20e31f", // Your data source ID
    searchOptions: {
      searchQuery: "top selling items",
      executeSearch: true,
    },
  });

  embed.render();
};
----

== Test natural language search embed

The final step is to test the Sage embed. Refresh the application (with cache disabled), then click the Sage link. You should see something like this:

== Activities

1. Add the nav link and handler to your code.
2. Import `SageEmbed`.
3. Use the playground to create a natural language search embed component.
4. Copy the search embed component from the playground to your code and modify the DIV ID.
5. Add a `render()` call.
6. Test the code.

If you run into issues, you can reference the code in the `src` folder.

== Files changed

* index.html
* tse.js
