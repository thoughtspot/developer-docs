:page-description: A summary of the ThoughtSpot Embedded course, additional resources, and next steps.

In this course, we covered a lot of topics related to embedding ThoughtSpot into your own applications to give the analytics power to the end users.
We covered the high-level concepts such as setup and security, as well as detailed implementations of the different types of embedding.
And finally finished up with a lesson on custom styles.

We hope you enjoyed this course and learned a lot.
ThoughtSpot Embedded is an area of key focus for ThoughtSpot, and we continue to add additional capabilities to give you more control.
You can expect to see updates on a regular basis.

=== CS Tools

CS Tools is a community-supported set of open source tools that allow you to do things like extract usage information, automate TML activities, and more easily manage users, etc.
See the link:https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/tools/[list of tools, window=_blank] for the current capabilities.
And if you are interested, you can even contribute ideas and code.
