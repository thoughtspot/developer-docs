:page-description: A summary of the ThoughtSpot Embedded course, additional resources, and next steps.

In this course we covered a lot of topics related to embedding ThoughtSpot into your own applications to give the analytics power to the end users. We covered the high-level concepts such as setup and security, as well as doing detailed implementations of the different types of embedding. And finally finished up with a discussion of custom styles.

We hope you enjoyed this course and learned a lot. TSE is an area of key focus for ThoughtSpot, and we continue to add additional capabilities to give you even more control. You can expect to see updates on a regular (approximately monthly) basis. To stay abreast of new features, be sure to monitor the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/whats-new[release notes] on the developer site.

=== CS Tools

CS Tools is a community-supported set of open source tools that allow you to do things like extract usage information, automate TML activities, and more easily manage users, etc. See the link:https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/tools/[list of tools] for the current capabilities. And if you are interested, you can even contribute ideas and code.
