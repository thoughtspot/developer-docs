:page-description: A summary of the ThoughtSpot Embedded course, additional resources, and next steps.

In this course, we covered a lot of topics related to embedding ThoughtSpot into your own applications to give the analytics power to the end users.
We covered the high-level concepts such as setup and security, as well as doing detailed implementations of the different types of embedding.
And finally finished up with a discussion of custom styles.

We hope you enjoyed this course and learned a lot.
ThoughtSpot Embedded is an area of key focus for ThoughtSpot, and we continue to add additional capabilities to give you even more control.
You can expect to see updates on a regular (approximately monthly) basis.
To stay abreast of new features, be sure to monitor the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/whats-new[release notes] on the developer site.

=== CS Tools

link:https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools[CS Tools, window=_blank] is not technically part of ThoughtSpot Embedded.
But it's useful enough to mention here.
CS Tools is a community-supported set of open source tools that allow you to do things like extract usage information, automate TML activities, and more easily manage users, etc.
See the link:https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/tools/[list of tools, window=_blank] for the current capabilities.
And if you are interested, you can even contribute ideas and code.
