= Event handling

:description: React components attach event handlers differently than the JavaScript Visual Embed SDK
:toc: true

The ThoughtSpot Visual Embed SDK provides a set of EmbedEvents that can be listened to and handled via callback functions.

== Event listener props
Every link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent[EmbedEvent^] has an equivalent *prop* in the React components where the event is applicable, with the naming pattern `on{EmbedEvent}`:

[,tsx]
----
// Required for referencing the LiveboardEmbed that is created in other code
const embedRef = useEmbedRef<typeof LiveboardEmbed>();

return <LiveboardEmbed 
        frameParams={{width:'100%',height:'100%'}}
        liveboardId={renderContent.split("|")[0]} 
        ref={embedRef} 
        onLiveboardRendered={afterEmbedRendered}
        onData={removeLoader}
        onSave={updateMenuSystem}
  />
----

== Using embedRef within a callback function

By setting the *ref* prop to the *embedRef* const declared earlier within the page, callback functions can refence the embed component within their code.
