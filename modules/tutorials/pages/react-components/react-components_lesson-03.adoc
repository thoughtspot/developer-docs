:description: Use REST APIs to create menus and other navigation elements

The ThoughtSpot component page from the previous lesson was designed to display any Liveboard with a valid ID as part of the URL.

While you can hardcode a set of known objects with their names and IDs into a navigation menu, ThoughtSpot's true power is allowing users to ask new questions and build their own answers and Liveboards.

The ThoughtSpot REST API provides the `xref:rest-api-v2-metadata-search.adoc
[/metadata/search]` endpoint for listing out the content on the ThoughtSpot instance, with a number of options for filtering or retrieving more details than default.

The REST API automatically filters the results based on the permissions of the user who makes the request.

The challenge is to ensure that the SDK use the session in the browser or a valid bearer token for the user logged into the app.

== /app/dashboard/page.tsx: a tabular menu of Liveboards
The example app has a dedicated link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/embed-example-react-app/blob/main/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx[/app/dashboard/page.tsx^] to display a tabular menu of available Liveboards.

There are two steps to this page:

1. Make a REST API request to ThoughtSpot to retrieve the details of the objects
2. Building the table from the results, constructing links to the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/embed-example-react-app/blob/main/src/app/dashboard/%5BdashboardId%5D/page.tsx[/dashboard/{dashboardId^] page to display the Liveboard.

=== Creating state variables
The menu page provides some UI options to configure the REST API request that generates the menu items. The pattern in React is for options to update shared link:https://react.dev/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state[state variables^] using the link:https://react.dev/reference/react/useState[useState()^] function, with updates triggered within components when the associated `setState()` function is called.

The page uses the following three state variables, with the defaults set by the initial `useState()` function:

[,typescript]
----
export default function DashboardList() {
    const [metadataData, setMetadataData] = useState<object | null>();
    const [showMyItems, setShowMyItems] = useState(false);
    const [authorName, setAuthorName] = useState('');
...
----

== ThoughtSpot REST API TypeScript SDK
ThoughtSpot provides a link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rest-api-sdk-typescript#_get_started[TypeScript REST API SDK^] that can be installed via Node and added to any React app.

The SDK allows calling any of the V2.0 REST API endpoints and returns in a native JSON format, making it ideal for retrieving the details of objects that a user can see.

=== Import REST API SDK
To use the REST API SDK, import `createConfiguration`, `ServerConfiguration` and `ThoughtSpotRestApi` from `@thoughtspot/rest-api-sdk`:
[,typescript]
----
"use client";

import {useEffect, useState} from "react";
import Link from 'next/link';

/*
* Menu page to list available Liveboards to link to LiveboardEmbed display page
*/

import {createConfiguration, ServerConfiguration, ThoughtSpotRestApi} from "@thoughtspot/rest-api-sdk";

import {constants} from "@/lib/constants";
----

Note the `"use client";` at the very beginning of the code - this tells React that the REST API calls should be coming from the user's browser, rather than made on the server side. React doesn't explictly separate front and backend layers the way many traditional web application platforms did, so you have to be intentional when you do have a preference.

=== Initializing the SDK for use
The REST API SDK uses an object returned by the imported `createConfiguration()` function to define the attributes necessary to authenticate for a particular ThoughtSpot instance. `createConfiguration()` takes an object with a `baseServer` property that is set to a `ServerConfiguration` option.

For the `ServerConfiguration` to use the ThoughtSpot session in the browser, rather than request a bearer token, it should be created like: `new ServerConfiguration(constants.tsURL, {})`. Examples of methods of authentication are available in the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rest-api-sdk-typescript#_setup_and_usage[REST API SDK documentation^].

Individual endpoints are called by instantiating a `ThoughtSpotRestApi` object with the `ServerConfiguration` object, then calling methods on the `ThoughtSpotRestApi` object.

[,typescript]
----
// API configuration using no auth.
const config = createConfiguration({
    baseServer: new ServerConfiguration(constants.tsURL, {}),
});
...
// Use ThoughtSpot REST API SDK 
const api = new ThoughtSpotRestApi(config);
----

=== Calling REST API endpoints within useEffect
The general naming pattern for the REST API SDK follows the exact name in the REST API Playground, in camelcase (as opposed to being named after the endpoint URL). The full set of endpoint methods is link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rest-api-sdk-typescript#_sdk_reference[documented here^]. 

Every endpoint method is an async call, so you will need to use the appropriate patterns with `async` and `return await` when using the calls:

To deal with the async nature of calling a REST API, particularly one outside of the React app itself, wrap any code that actually issues a REST API commands inside a React `link:https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect[useEffect( () =>{ })^]` block:

[,typescript]
----
// Wrapper function to retrieve current username from around api.getCurrentUserInfo() 
const fetchUserName = async () => {
    const userInfo = await api.getCurrentUserInfo();
    console.log('user === ' + userInfo.name);
    setAuthorName(userInfo.name);
}

useEffect(() => {
    // Run necessary REST API calls before rendering the menu
    fetchUserName().then();
...
}
----

For endpoints that take a body, declare a `const` and set it to the JSON body exactly as copied from the REST API Playground. You can add in optional logic to tie in to the UI state of the React app to change the arguments of the request body:
[,typescript]
----
// Define the options for the metadata/search call
const metadataOptions = {
    record_size: -1,
    include_headers: true,
    metadata: [
        {
            "type": "LIVEBOARD"
        }
    ]
}

if (showMyItems) {
    metadataOptions['created_by_user_identifiers'] = [authorName];
}
...
const fetchFilteredData = await api.searchMetadata(metadataOptions);
----

Once the results come back, it is best to store them to a state variable:

[,typescript]
----
const [showMyItems, setShowMyItems] = useState(false);
...
useEffect(() => {
 ...
 fetchFilteredData().then(); // Call the async function
}, [showMyItems]);
----

== Render the component
The visible UI of the page, including the tabular menu, is outside the `useEffect` function. It is created by returning JSX, including some logical operators to vary what displays depending on the current UI state.

=== My Items filter checkbox
At the top of the page, there is an input of `type="checkbox"`, that determines if the REST API results are filtered only to items created by the current user.

[,tsx]
----
// Return the actual page after the API response has been retrieved
return (
...
            {/* Checkbox for My Items filter */}
            <label className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <input
                    type="checkbox"
                    className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600 border-gray-300 rounded"
                    checked={showMyItems}
                    onChange={(e) => setShowMyItems(e.target.checked)}
                />
                <span className="text-gray-700">Show my items</span>
            </label>
...
----

If you are unfamiliar with React, JSX format looks like HTML but has a syntax for variables that uses curly braces.

Setting `checked={showMyItems}` within the `<input>` tag sets the value to match the current boolean `showMyItems` state variable set at the start of the page. Then the `onChange` function calls the `setShowMyItems()` function to update the state variable when the box is checked or unchecked.

The `setShowMyItems()` function also triggers any other part of the component that listens for state changes to update. 

The `useEffect()` function takes an array of state variables to listen to as it's second argument, at the very end of it's block:
[,typescript]
----
const [showMyItems, setShowMyItems] = useState(false);
...
useEffect(() => {
 ...
 fetchFilteredData().then(); // Call the async function
}, [showMyItems]);
----

The result is that a change triggerd by the checkbox UI causes the REST API endpoint to be called again, updating the `metadataData` state variable, before the menu table component is re-rendered with the new API response.

Note that this a very simple implementation and does call the ThoughtSpot REST API on every change of the UI. ThoughtSpot's REST API is very efficient at answering the `/metadata/search` endpoint, but mechanisms to cache the results could be implemented within the React page to lessen the number of unnecessary API calls.

=== Table of items and descriptions
The menu itself is a basic HTML table with two columns.

The first column displays the Liveboard names as links to the `/dashboard/[dashboardId]` page, and the second column is the text description property.

The code uses JSX variables and logical operators to display a `No dashboards found` message instead of the table, is the length of the response set from the REST API is found to be 0.

If not, it uses the `{metadataData.map((item) => ()` syntax to go through every item in the response, making the properties of the item available as the `item` variable for use within the components.

[,tsx]
----
{metadataData && metadataData.length > 0 ? (

<div className="h-[65vh] overflow-auto border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
    <table className="table-fixed border-collapse border border-gray-200 w-full">
        <thead>
        <tr className="bg-gray-100">
            <th className="border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 text-left w-1/2">Name</th>
            <th className="border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 text-left">Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        {/* Build each row of the menu */}
        {metadataData.map((item) => (
            <tr key={item.metadata_id} className="border-b border-gray-200">
                <td className="w-1/3 border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 hover:underline">
                    {/* Build the Link to the /dashboard/[dashboardId] routes */}
                    <Link href={`/dashboard/${encodeURIComponent(item.metadata_id.trim())}`}>
                        {item.metadata_name}
                    </Link>
                </td>
                {/* Add description from metadata to the second column */}
                <td className="w-1/3 border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2">
                    {item.metadata_header.description || ''}
                </td>
            </tr>
        ))}
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
) : (
    <p className="text-gray-500 text-center">No dashboards found</p>
)}
----

The most important aspect is building the `Link` component with the route to the component display page built in the previous lesson, and the `item.metadata_id` property as the end of the URL.

[,typescript]
----
<Link href={`/dashboard/${encodeURIComponent(item.metadata_id.trim())}`}>
    {item.metadata_name}
</Link>
----

When this page renders, there is now a dynamic menu to get to any Liveboard the user has access to, with the ability to filter to easily filter to own created content.

== Spotter embed pages and menu
The example app contains an equivalent menu and component display page for Spotter content, under the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/embed-example-react-app/tree/main/src/app/datachat[/app/datachat/^] subdirectory. 

Spotter conversations are started against Models (formerly Worksheets), so the set of UI components and filters differs within the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/embed-example-react-app/blob/main/src/app/datachat/page.tsx[menu page^].

The basic concepts from the entire tutorial apply regardless of which component you are using.
