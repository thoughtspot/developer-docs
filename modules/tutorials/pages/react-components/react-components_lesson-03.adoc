:description: Use REST APIs to create menus and other navigation elements

The ThoughtSpot component page from the previous lesson was designed to display any Liveboard with a valid ID as part of the URL.

While you can hardcode a set of known objects with their names and IDs into a navigation menu, ThoughtSpot's true power is allowing users to ask new questions and build their own answers and Liveboards.

The ThoughtSpot REST API provides the `/metadata/search` endpoint for listing out the content on the ThoughtSpot instance.

The REST API automatically filters the results to those objects a user has been granted access to via sharing, and provides many arguments for further filtering of the result set.
