:description: Initializing ThoughtSpot Embed SDK within React app


The Visual Embed SDK provides an `init()` *function* that handles authentication and other shared configuration options for all SDK components.

In your code, you need to call `init()` before any other ThoughtSpot components are loaded.

In the tutorial app, which is *only* displaying ThoughtSpot content, the `init()` function is run as soon as the app is loaded, in the `layout.tsx` file, via the `ThoughtSpotEmbed` component.

The link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_EmbedConfig[various configurations^] can be used exactly as defined within the standard Visual Embed SDK documentation, because the `init()` function is called within the TypeScript code of the component page, outside of the React component portions defined in JSX/TSX.

== components/ThoughtSpotEmbed.tsx: running init() one time for all components
The pattern within `link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/embed-example-react-app/blob/main/src/components/ThoughtSpotEmbed.tsx[components/ThoughtSpotEmbed.tsx^]` is important, because it defines any initial configurations and other functions, and runs the `init()` function only once.

At the bottom, we run the `tsInitialize()` function once, and then return a `div` with `id=ts-embed` that will be used as the container for any individual ThoughtSpot embed components loaded by the app later:

[,tsx]
----
 tsInitialize();

return (
    <div className="w-full h-full">
        <div className="w-full h-full" id="ts-embed">
            {children}
        </div>
    </div>
);
----

The `tsInitialize()` function wraps around the entire process of calling the `init()` function from the Visual Embed SDK (note that authentication has not been implemented in this example):

[source,typescript]
----
    const tsInitialize = () => {
        console.log("Initializing ThoughtSpot SDK");

        // init() function defines basic configuration and authentication for all ThoughtSpot embed components
        // See https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_EmbedConfig for all  configurations
        const ee = init({
            thoughtSpotHost: constants.tsURL,
            authType: AuthType.None,
            username: constants.username,
            getAuthToken: () => {
                return getAuthToken(constants.username);
            },
            callPrefetch: true,
            customizations: {},
        } as EmbedConfig);

        // Checks for Auth process completed as expected
        if (ee) {
            ee.on(AuthStatus.SUCCESS, () => {
                console.log("Success");
            })
                .on(AuthStatus.SDK_SUCCESS, () => {
                    console.log("SDK Success");
                })
                .on(AuthStatus.FAILURE, (reason) => {
                    console.log("Failure:  " + reason);
                });
        }
    };
----

== Common customizations in the init
As mentioned above, link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_EmbedConfig[many configuration options] can be specified as part of the `init()` function.

Common configurations include xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[prefetch for better performance] and the `link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Interface_EmbedConfig#_autologin[autoLogin: true]` property when using xref:trusted-authentication.adoc[Trusted Authentication].

You'll notice in the app options for some of the most common set of configurations involve link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/tutorials/style-customization/tutorial[style customizations^] such as CSS and text string replacement:

[source,JavaScript]
----
 customizations: {
    style: {
        customCSS: customCss,
    },
    content: {
        strings: stringsCustom
    },
    iconSpriteUrl: iconUrl
}
