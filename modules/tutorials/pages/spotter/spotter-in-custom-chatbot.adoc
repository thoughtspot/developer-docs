:page-description: Tutorial to integrate Spotter into your own Chatbot


In this article, we'll use ThoughtSpot's https://github.com/thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk[Visual Embed SDK^] to add analytics and interactive data visualizations to your own chatbot. To view the full code used in this tutorial, visit our link:https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/bodyless-sample-doc-5q3dwr[CodeSandbox^].

== Install Visual Embed SDK

----
 $ npm i @thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk
----

== Configure security and authentication

. Add the URL of the host application, which embeds ThoughtSpot visualizations, to the CSP allowlist. This includes adding the correct CORS and frame-ancestors CSP.
+
For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc#_add_domains_to_csp_and_cors_allowlists[Security settings].

. Configure the authentication scheme that works best for your use case.
+
Read the https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/embed-auth[Authentication documentation] and choose the scheme that best suits your implementation.
+
In this tutorial, we'll use `AuthType.None`. We assume you are logged into your ThoughtSpot instance in a different browser tab.

== Get the data model

Make sure you have already connected your database and created a ThoughtSpot data model. Log into your instance to get the `id` of the data model you want to use.

For this tutorial, we'll use the link:https://try-everywhere.thoughtspot.cloud/#/everywhere[demo^] Thoughtspot instance with a sample data model.

== Initialize the SDK

[source,javascript]
----
import {
  BodylessConversation,
  init,
  AuthType,
} from "@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk";

init({
  thoughtSpotHost: "https://<your-instance>.thoughtspot.cloud",
  authType: AuthType.None, // Or your authentication scheme.
});
----

== Create a conversation

To use the Spotter conversational analytics, let's start by creating a new conversation. This conversation holds the context of all messages sent to ThoughtSpot by your bot. This enables a truly conversational experience for your chatbot users.

[source,javascript]
----
const conversation = new BodylessConversation({
    worksheetId: "<data-model-id>",
  });
----

== Send messages and get interactive visualizations in response

After creating a conversation, we'll use it to send messages to the ThoughtSpot Spotter AI. Spotter evaluates and generates data on your data model, and returns a visualization in response.

[source,javascript]
----
// Get the response from ThoughtSpot Spotter
const { container } = await conversation.sendMessage(message);

// Create a new DOM element, to host the visualization returned above.
const div = document.createElement("div");

// Add any styling you might want to this element.
div.classList.add("viz");
// Add the container of the visualization as contents to this dom element.
div.append(container);
// insert the DOM into your application.
app.insertAdjacentElement("beforeend", div);
----

== That's all!

And thatâ€™s a wrap! This was a super quick tutorial on how to use Spotter embed APIs to integrate conversational analytics with your chatbot!
