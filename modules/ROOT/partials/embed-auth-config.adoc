authType::
_String_. Authentication type. Valid values for the `authType` attribute are:

None;;
Allows using your existing IdP setup and the SAML or OIDC configuration on ThoughtSpot to authenticate an embedded application user. Use this method if your IdP allows handling the authentication flow within the iFrame.

EmbeddedSSO;;
Automatically redirects users to the IdP within the iFrame. If your IdP supports iFrame redirects and your ThoughtSpot instance is configured to use a SAML IdP or OpenID provider, you can use this method for seamless user authentication.
For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

Basic;;
Allows authenticating and logging in a user using the ThoughtSpot `/tspublic/v1/session/login` API. The API request passes `username` and `password` parameters to obtain an authentication token. For more information, see xref:session-api.adoc[Session API].

+
[WARNING]
Do not use this authentication method in production environments.

SAMLRedirect;;
Allows configuring redirects from the embedded app to the SAML IdP. Use this method if your SAML IdP does not natively support embedding. When embedded content loads, the SDK redirects the app to the IdP login page for authentication.
+

* `noRedirect` __Optional__
+
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, it opens the SAML SSO authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page.

* `redirectPath` __Optional__
+
__String__. Allows adding a redirect path string to the host origin. If the `redirectPath` attribute is configured, the SAML SSO authentication flow will be terminated on the specified redirect path.

+
Do not include the host URL in the path string; for example, `/dashboard`.

+
For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc#saml-sso-embed[SAML SSO authentication].

OIDCRedirect;;
Allows configuring redirects from the embedded app to OpenID Provider. Use this method if your OpenID Provider does not support the authentication flow within an iFrame. When embedded content loads, the SDK redirects the app to the OpenID Provider login page for authentication.
To allow embedded application users to authenticate to an OpenID provider, your ThoughtSpot instance must have the xref:configure-oidc.adoc[OIDC authentication support] enabled.

OIDC;;
Allows configuring redirects from the embedded app to OpenID Provider. When embedded content loads, the SDK redirects the app to the OpenID Provider login page for authentication.
To allow embedded application users to authenticate to an OpenID provider, your ThoughtSpot instance must have the xref:configure-oidc.adoc[OIDC authentication support] enabled.

TrustedAuthToken;;
Enables trusted authentication method. To use the trusted authentication method, specify the trusted authentication server in the `authEndpoint` attribute or use the `getAuthToken` method.

+
* `authEndpoint` __Optional__
+
_String_. The endpoint URL of the authentication server. If the `authEndPoint` attribute is defined, a `GET`   request is sent to the authentication endpoint, which returns the authentication token as plain text in its API response. This attribute is not required if `getAuthToken` is used.

* `username`
+
_String_. The username of the ThoughtSpot user.


* `getAuthToken` __Optional__

+
A function that invokes the trusted authentication endpoint and returns a `Promise` string that resolves to the authentication token. This attribute is not required if `authEndpoint` is used. +

    getAuthToken: () => Promise.resolve(token)

+
We recommend that you fetch a new token inside this method instead of using an existing token. When a session expires and if this method is called again with an old token, the user authentication may fail.

+
For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-embed[Trusted authentication].
