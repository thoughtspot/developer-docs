+
For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_commit_files_and_changes[Commit files].

==== Deploy API enhancements
The `deploy_policy` property in the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` endpoint now supports the `VALIDATE_ONLY` option, which allows you to compare and validate TML content on the destination environment against the content in the main branch before deploying commits.

Note the following points when using `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` to deploy your changes:

* The `branch_name` attribute is now mandatory in the API requests. Ensure that you specify the name of the Git branch from which the commits can be picked and deployed on the destination environment or Org.
* After a successful deployment, a tracking file is generated with the `commit_id` and saved in the Git branch that is used for storing configuration files. The `commit_id` recorded in the tracking file is used for comparing changes when new commits are pushed in the subsequent API calls.

For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_deploy_commits[Deploy commits].

=== Feature deprecations

In 10.1.0.sw release, the following features are deprecated and removed from the UI:

==== Version Control APIs

This release introduces the following enhancements to the Version Control API endpoints:

===== Git connection creation and update APIs

The `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/create` and `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/update` API endpoints include the following enhancements:

New parameters::

* `commit_branch_name` +
Allows configuring a commit branch for Git connections on your ThoughtSpot instance. ThoughtSpot recommends using `commit_branch_name` instead of `default_branch_name` in the API calls to prevent users from committing changes to the default deployment branch.
* `configuration_branch_name` +
Allows configuring a separate Git branch for storing and maintaining configuration files, such as GUID mapping and commit tracking files. If the `configuration_branch_name` property is defined, the `guid_mapping_branch_name` parameter is not required.

Modified parameters::
The `enable_guid_mapping` parameter is enabled by default.

Separate branches for Orgs::
If you are using Orgs and want to move content between these Orgs using version control APIs, ensure that you set a separate Git branch for each Org. If two Orgs are connected to the same Git `repository_url`, the `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/create` and `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/update` API endpoints do not support configuring the same branch name for these Orgs.

Deprecation notice::

The `default_branch_name` and `guid_mapping_branch_name` parameters will be deprecated from version 10.0.0.sw and later releases. For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#connectTS[Connect your ThoughtSpot environment to the Git repository].

===== Commit API

The `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/branches/commit` API endpoint allows the following new attribute in the request body:

* `delete_aware`
+
When set to true, the system runs a check between the objects and files in the Git branch and destination environment or Org. If an object exists in the Git branch, but not the destination environment or Org, it will be deleted from the Git branch during the commit operation.

For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_commit_files_and_changes[Commit files].

===== Deploy API

Note the following changes:

* The `branch_name` attribute is now mandatory in the `POST /api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` API requests. Ensure that you specify the name of the Git branch from which the commits can be picked and deployed on the destination environment or Org.

* After a successful deployment, a tracking file is generated with the `commit_id` and saved in the Git branch that is used for storing configuration files. The `commit_id` recorded in the tracking file is used for comparing changes when new commits are pushed in the subsequent API calls.

For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_deploy_commits[Deploy commits].

=== SDK for TypeScript

ThoughtSpot provides TypeScript SDK to help client applications call REST APIs using TypeScript. You can download the SDK from the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/rest-api-sdk?activeTab=readme[NPM site, window=_blank].


== Version 9.5.0.sw, October 2023

=== Cookieless Trusted authentication

Developers can now enable cookieless authentication when embedding ThoughtSpot in their applications. The cookieless authentication method allows the use of a bearer token instead of session cookies when users interact with embedded content or initiate API requests. If the embedded content does not load from the same domain as your embedding application, and your Web browser does not allow third-party cookies, you can use Cookieless authentication in the Trusted authentication mode.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-embed[Trusted authentication].

=== Visual Embed Playground enhancements

The Visual Embed developer Playground now allows you to register a Host event and trigger an action by clicking the *Try* button.

For more information, see xref:embed-events.adoc#host-events[Events reference].

==== GraphQL playground [beta betaBackground]^Beta^

The *Develop* tab in the ThoughtSpot UI introduces the GraphQL playground to allow users to interact with GraphQL endpoints and run query and mutation operations. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

For more information, see xref:graphql-playground.adoc[GraphQL Playground].

=== Version control and Git integration

You can now connect your ThoughtSpot instance to a Git repository and push commits from your application instance to a Git branch via REST API. With the Git integration [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ feature, ThoughtSpot provides the ability to integrate your application environment with Git workflows and deploy commits from a development instance to a production cluster.

For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_guid_mapping[Git integration and version control].

=== Custom styles

The following new variables are now available for custom styling of the ThoughtSpot Search page:

* `--ts-var-search-auto-complete-font-color`
* `--ts-var-search-auto-complete-subtext-font-color`
* `--ts-var-answer-edit-panel-background-color`

For more information, see xref:css-customization.adoc#_search_bar_and_data_panel[Customize CSS].

=== Link customization

You can now customize the navigation links in your app using the *Generic link* option in the *Develop* > *Customization* > *Link settings* page.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc#_customize_link_format[Customize links].

=== Runtime Parameter overrides

Embedded application users can now create Worksheet and Answer Parameters to optimize data queries. You can also adjust values and apply overrides at runtime on a Liveboard or Answer either via REST API or by appending Parameters to the query URL in the UI.

For more information, see xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[Runtime Parameter overrides].

=== Role-Based Access Control

The role-based access control (RBAC) [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ feature allows administrators to create a role in the UI or via REST API calls and assign a set of privileges. With the RBAC feature, you can assign granular permissions and control user access to ThoughtSpot features and application workflows.

The RBAC feature is turned off by default. To enable this feature, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

=== Liveboard experience in embedded mode

The following features and enhancements are now available for embedded Liveboards.

==== Cross filters on Liveboard visualizations

ThoughtSpot supports brushing and linking of visualizations on a Liveboard using cross filters. Cross filters allow you to present a coordinated view of a Liveboard by applying filters across all visualizations based on the current selection.

To hide or disable the cross filter feature on an embedded instance, you can use the `Action.CrossFilter` and `Action.RemoveCrossFilter` parameters in the SDK.

For more information, see xref:Action.adoc[Actions].

===== Contextual menu behavior

By default, the contextual menu in ThoughtSpot application pages is set as a right-click pop-up menu. To trigger the contextual menu on left-click or right-click on an embedded app, you can use the `contextMenuTrigger` property in the Visual Embed SDK. In the following example, the contextual menu is configured to trigger on left-click.

----
contextMenuTrigger: "left-click"
----

----
contextMenuTrigger: ContextMenuTriggerOptions.LEFT_CLICK
----

When set as right-click menu (default behavior)::
The contextual menu opens on right-click. If you want to monitor right-click actions and listen to the right-click events on a chart or table, use `EmbedEvent.VizPointRightClick` event. For more information, see xref:events-ref.adoc#_vizpointrightclick[VizPointRightClick].

When set as left-click menu::
The contextual opens on left-click. If your app is already using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to listen to left-click events on a visualization, the `VizPointClick` event will be triggered whenever a user clicks on an action in the contextual menu. If you are using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to trigger actions such as updating runtime filters on a Liveboard visualization, the click events from left-click contextual menu may impact your app’s current workflow.

+
We recommend using a development environment to test your customizations before rolling them out on production servers. For more information, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

==== Note tiles on Liveboards

In the new Liveboard experience mode, you can now add Note tiles with custom text, images, and links. This feature is turned off by default and can be enabled by ThoughtSpot administrators.

For more information, see xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc#noteTiles[Note tiles].

=== Visual Embed SDK

== Version 9.0.1.sw, June 2023

=== Advanced style customization

You can now override style specifications of the embedded UI pages and elements using custom CSS properties. Custom CSS provides granular control over the design elements and lets you modify the styles
to match the look and feel of your host application.

You can also preview the allowed style overrides in the Visual Embed Playground by selecting the *Apply custom styles* checkbox.

For more information, see xref:style-customization.adoc[Customize styles and layout] and xref:css-customization.adoc[Customize CSS].

=== New Liveboard experience

The xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc[new Liveboard experience] is now Generally Available (GA) on embedded instances and is enabled by default.

=== REST API v2.0 endpoints and Playground

Starting with 9.0.1.sw, the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ API endpoints are deprecated and removed from the REST API v2 Playground. A set of new endpoints are now generally available (GA) on all ThoughtSpot instances.

The new REST API v2.0 endpoints introduce several improvements to the request and response structure and let you perform more tasks in a single API call. For example, you can create a new user, map the user to groups and Orgs, set home Liveboards for the user, and assign privileges in a single API request.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* All REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints are deprecated, but remain functional until further notice. The REST API SDK that was available with REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version is no longer supported. +
ThoughtSpot does not recommend using REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints for production use cases. For more information, see xref:deprecated-features.adoc#_deprecation_of_rest_v2_api[Deprecation announcements].
* The new REST API v2.0 endpoints are not an extension of the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints. The resource categories, base path, endpoint URIs, and the structure of API requests and responses are different from those of the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version.
* Some API operations such as the CRUD operations for data connections and passing runtime filters on Liveboard visualizations are not available in the initial release. For more information, see xref:rest-api-v1v2-comparison.adoc[REST API v1 and v2.0 comparison] and xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc[REST API v2.0 reference].
====

=== Search bar embedding
You can now embed the ThoughtSpot search bar component in your app. For example, if you are using Google Sheets for data analysis, you can embed the ThoughtSpot search bar and let your users search data from a specific data source. The embedded Search bar allows passing search tokens and modifying search options. You can also retrieve the search results as raw data and let your host application render it in the format you want.

For more information, see xref:embed-searchbar.adoc[Embed ThoughtSpot search bar].

=== CSP allowlist for font, image and stylesheet sources

You can now enable CSP overrides for font, stylesheet, and image sources in ThoughtSpot UI. If you want to load fonts, stylesheets, images, or favicons from an external source, add the source URLs to the CSP allowlist on the *Security Settings* page.

For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc#_add_trusted_domains_for_font_css_and_image_import[Security Settings].

=== Just-in-time user creation and dynamic privilege assignment

Starting from 9.0.1.sw, the xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token] endpoint supports just-in-time provisioning of users. If the user specified in the API request does not exist in the ThoughtSpot system, you can set the `autocreate` property to `true` to add the user to ThoughtSpot and assign the user to `groups`.

=== Improvements to authentication methods and AuthType enums in the SDK

The following changes are introduced in the Visual Embed SDK to improve the authentication framework and options for embedded application users:

* New auth type enum for embedded SSO authentication
+
The `AuthType.EmbeddedSSO` enum allows you to enable SSO login on embedded instances. This authentication method allows you to use your current SAML IdP or OpenID Connect configuration and redirect users to the IdP for authentication within the embedded iFrame.

* Changes to the existing `AuthType` enums: +
** `AuthType.SAML` is renamed as `AuthType.SAMLRedirect` +
** `AuthType.OIDC` is renamed as `AuthType.OIDCRedirect` +
** `AuthType.AuthServer` is renamed to `AuthType.TrustedAuthToken` +

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

=== Early access features

Starting from 9.0.1.sw, ThoughtSpot allows its administrators to turn on Early Access features from the Admin portal. Early Access features are qualified by ThoughSpot for customer use but are not enabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances until the features are GA.

The 9.0.1.sw release introduces the following Early Access features:

* Custom maps

== Version 8.8.1.sw, January 2023

ThoughtSpot 8.8.1.sw release version is now generally available!

The 8.8.1.sw release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

=== New Liveboard experience

This release introduces the new Liveboard experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^  on ThoughtSpot instances. The new Liveboard experience is in Beta on embedded instances and is turned off by default.

The new Liveboard experience includes several new features and user-experience improvements to the *Liveboard* page:

Liveboard editing::
To edit a Liveboard, users must switch to the edit mode by clicking the *Edit* button on the Liveboard page.
The edit mode allows you to edit the Liveboard title and description text, apply filters, copy the Liveboard, modify the layout of the visualization tiles, delete a visualization, and so on.

Liveboard tabs::

The new Liveboard experience supports organizing visualizations in tabs. Users with edit access to a Liveboard can add, edit, and move visualizations to Tabs on a Liveboard. On embedded ThoughtSpot instances, developers can set a specific tab as an active tab using the Visual Embed SDK.
+
For more information, see xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc#_customize_liveboard_tabs[Customize Liveboard tabs].

Custom tile size for visualizations on a Liveboard::

The new Liveboard experience allows you to customize the tile size of a visualization on a Liveboard. In the classic experience, ThoughtSpot allowed resizing visualizations using predefined layout options available in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]. With custom tile size, users can now change the size of a visualization just by clicking and dragging the tile to the desired size.

Liveboard filters::
* The Liveboard filter configuration options are available on a single modal.
* When a user creates a copy of a Liveboard, the filters applied to its visualizations are also copied.

Other features and enhancements::
* The *Add filters* action is placed in the primary menu bar and can be viewed only when a Liveboard is in edit mode. Only users with edit access to the Liveboard can apply filters.
* The *Undo*, *Redo*, and *Reset* actions for visualizations.
* The *Liveboard Info* action label in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu is renamed to *Show Liveboard details*.
* The *Schedule* action is placed in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
* Improved visualization Explore experience.

Deprecated features::
The following features are *_not_* available with the new Liveboard experience:
* The *Copy embed link* and *Copy link* menu actions in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu of a Liveboard
* The edit title icon on visualization tiles
* The *Share* button on visualizations

+
For more information about the new Liveboard experience, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-experience-new[New Liveboard experience, window=_blank].

Actions and Events in the SDK::
If you have enabled the new Liveboard experience on your instance, you can use the `Action` and `Event` enumeration members available in the SDK package to customize an embedded object and improve interactivity.

+
For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum. Similarly, you can trigger events such as  `VizPointClick`  on visualizations in an embedded Liveboard.

==== New Liveboard experience rollout on embedded instances

The new Liveboard experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^  is turned off by default on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. If you are using the Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot, you can xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc[set the `liveboardV2` parameter] in the SDK package to `true` to enable the new experience globally for all users on your instance. +
