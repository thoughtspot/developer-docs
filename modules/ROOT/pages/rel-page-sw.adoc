:page-description: This article sumamrizes the embedding support and ThoughtSpot Everywhere features available on ThoughtSpot Software clusters.

ThoughtSpot Software clusters now support ThoughtSpot Everywhere and embedding with Visual Embed SDK!

Starting from the 8.4.1-sw release, ThoughtSpot Software customers who have a license to embed ThoughtSpot can use ThoughtSpot Everywhere features and Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot objects in their apps.

== Embedding methods

For information about the embedding options available for your deployments, see xref:embed-methods.adoc#_supported_embedding_methods[Supported embedding methods].


== Embedding with Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK provides Javascript-based embed packages and client libraries to help you embed the following ThoughtSpot components in your web application: +

* xref:embed-search.adoc[ThoughtSpot Search]
* xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Liveboards]
* xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Individual visualizations from a Liveboard]
* xref:full-embed.adoc[Individual application pages or the full application]

Developers can also customize embedded objects using the APIs in the SDK: +

* xref:embed-search.adoc[modify the layout of the embedded Search page]
* xref:full-embed.adoc[customize the layout and home tabs in the embedded ThoughtSpot view]
* xref:embed-actions.adoc[show or hide UI actions]
* xref:runtime-filters.adoc[apply runtime filters]
* xref:embed-events.adoc[trigger events and respond to events with an action]
* xref:custom-actions.adoc[handle callback custom actions] that trigger a callback and send ThoughtSpot data in a response payload to the parent app.

=== Supported SDK versions

The minimum SDK version required for embedding ThoughtSpot Software in your app is `1.12.0`.

You can upgrade to a later version if required. However, you must exercise caution before upgrading to a new version because the new versions may introduce breaking changes. The new version may also include APIs, methods, and attributes for features that are not yet available on your ThoughtSpot Software release.

For more information about the SDK versions, supported methods and classes, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed Changelog] and xref:VisualEmbedSdk.adoc[Visual Embed SDK Reference Guide].

== REST API

REST API v1 operations are supported on ThoughtSpot Software by default. You can make API calls to query data, add and modify ThoughtSpot objects, and perform administrative tasks.

The *Develop* tab in the UI also allows you to explore REST API v1 and REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ request and response workflows.

For a complete list of endpoints and information about allowed operations, see xref:rest-api-reference.adoc[REST API v1 Reference] and xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc[REST API v2 ^BETA^ Reference].
