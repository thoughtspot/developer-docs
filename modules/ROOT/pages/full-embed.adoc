:page-title: Embed Full Application
:page-pageid: full-embed
:page-description: You can embed full ThoughtSpot experience in your application and allow your users to create content for live analytics

The full app embedding allows you to embed the full ThoughtSpot application or the individual application pages in your app.

Full app embedding gives you all the features of ThoughtSpot, with the ability to use additional features and customization from the Visual Embed SDK, such as custom actions and CSS styling rules.

The basic layout and feature set of the various pages of the ThoughtSpot application in full app embedding is relatively fixed, so if you need more control, use the xref:embed-search.adoc[SearchEmbed] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[LiveboardEmbed] components. You can xref:page-navigation.adoc[control/customize navigation] within your web application using the full app or other embed components.

[NOTE]
====
We do not recommend mixing full app embedding with the xref:embed-search.adoc[SearchEmbed] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[LiveboardEmbed] components.
====

== UI experience

The ThoughtSpot UI and navigation experience is available in two modes:

* Classic experience (default)
* New navigation and homepage experience [earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#
+
By default, the New navigation and homepage experience is turned off on ThoughtSpot embedding applications. To enable the new experience for your embedding application users, set `modularHomeExperience` to `true`.
+
For more information about new navigation and homepage experience and customization controls for full application embedding, see xref:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/full-app-customize[Customize full application embedding].

== Import the AppEmbed package
Import the AppEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,javascript]
----
import {
    AppEmbed,
    Page,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
    EmbedEvent
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,javascript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        AppEmbed,
        Page,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch,
        EmbedEvent
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

xref:getting-started.adoc#initSdk[Initialize the SDK] and define authentication attributes.

== Create an instance of the AppEmbed object

Create an instance of the AppEmbed object and pass parameters to set a page view.

[source,javascript]
----
const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    pageId: Page.Home,
});
----

////
[source,javascript]
----
const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    additionalFlags: {
    <key>: <value>
    },
    disabledActions: [],
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>',
    disableHelpAndProfile: false,
    hideObjects: ['<object-id>'],
    hiddenActions: [],
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    pageId: Page.Data,
    path: '<url-string>',
    runtimeFilters: [],
    tag: '<tag-name>',
});
----

frameParams:: Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the pages in the web application. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage.

The `AppEmbed` component allows you to embed a specific application page or the entire application experience. If you are embedding full application, you can xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_choose_the_page_to_load[choose to show a specific page when embedded content loads] using the  `pageId` or `path` property. The `AppEmbed` component also provides  several customization controls to customize full application experience in an embedded view. For more information, see the following pages:

* xref:full-app-customize.adoc[Customize full application embedding] +
* xref:AppEmbed.adoc[AppEmbed] +
* xref:AppViewConfig.adoc[LiveboardViewConfig] +
* xref:Action.adoc[Actions]




////
disabledActions __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Disables the specified actions. You can use this attribute to restrict user access to certain features.
+
For example, to disable the *Show underlying data* action in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify `Action.ShowUnderlyingData` in the `disabledActions` attribute.

+
----
disabledActions: [Action.ShowUnderlyingData]

disabledActionReason __Optional__::
_String_. The text to show for disabled actions. The text string specified in `disabledActionReason` shows as a tooltip when a user hovers over a disabled action in the embedded UI. For example, if you have disabled the `Download` action and you intend to enable this action for only authorized users, you can specify `disabledActionReason` as `Contact your administrator to enable this feature`.

hiddenActions __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Hides the specified actions from the list of available actions in the embedded ThoughtSpot UI. You can use this attribute to remove the actions that are not relevant to your application context. Use this attribute only if `visibleActions` are not defined. 

+
For example, to hide the *Share* action, specify `Action.Share` in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
----
hiddenActions: [Action.Share]
----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++


visibleActions __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Displays the specified actions in the embedded ThoughtSpot UI. These actions can appear as buttons, or as menu actions in  **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] or the contextual menu. You can use this attribute to show a small subset of actions from the list of available actions.

+
[NOTE]

runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the Liveboard or visualization page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to pass filter specifications in the URL query parameters and filter data at the time of retrieval.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `100000` in the `Revenue` column for a visualization in a Liveboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
    columnName: 'Revenue',
    operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
    values: [100000]
}]
----
