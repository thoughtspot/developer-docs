For example, the `reportBookData`, and `vizData` attributes are modified, and the custom action `id` now is part of the data attribute. These changes may break your current custom action event handlers. For interoperability, we recommend adding the data attribute to `payload` in your code as shown in the example here:

[source,JavaScript]

----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, payload => {
    if (payload.id === "callback-action-id" \|\| payload.data.id === "callback-action-id") {
        console.log('Custom Action event:', payload.data);
    }
})
----

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# | +++<h5>Render embedded objects in queue</h5>+++

The SDK now supports rendering embedded objects in a queue. If you have multiple embedded objects, you can enable the `queueMultiRenders` parameter to queue your embedded objects and render them one after another. This feature helps in decreasing the load on the web browsers and improving your application loading experience. By default, this attribute is set to `false`.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Liveboard embed</h5>+++

The `pinboardEmbed` package includes the `defaultHeight` attribute that sets a minimum height for embedded objects on a pinboard page, and the corresponding visualization pages that a user can navigate to.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc[Embed a pinboard].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Embed events</h5>+++

The SDK EmbedEvent library includes the following new events:

* `VizPointDoubleClick`

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++Prefetch API+++</h5>+++

The `prefetch` API fetches static resources from a given URL before your application loads. Web browsers can then cache the prefetched resources locally and serve them from a user's local disk. You can use this API to load the embedded objects faster and improve your application response time.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++In-app page navigation+++</h5>+++

The `navigateToPage` method in the SDK lets you provide quick and direct access to a specific pinboard, saved Answer, or an application page. You can add a custom menu action or button in your application UI that calls the `navigateToPage` method and leads your users to the page specified in the `path` parameter.

For more information, see xref:page-navigation.adoc[Add a custom action for in-app navigation].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++Full application embedding+++</h5>+++

The `appEmbed` SDK package includes the following new attributes:

* The `disableProfileAndHelp` attribute to show or hide the `Help (?)` and the user profile menu in the navigation bar of your embedded app.

* The `hideObjects` attribute to hide specific objects from a user's page view.

For more information, see xref:full-embed.adoc[Embed full application].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# |+++<h5>+++Search embed +++</h5>+++

The `searchEmbed` package includes the `forceTable` attribute that sets tabular view as the default format for presenting search data. You can use set this attribute to `true` to force search results to appear in the table view.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag redBackground]#REMOVED# |

The `searchQuery` parameter is no longer supported and is removed from the `searchEmbed` SDK package.
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++Embed events +++</h5>+++
The SDK EmbedEvent library includes the following events:

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE#  a|  +++<h5>searchOptions</h5>+++

The `searchEmbed` SDK package introduces the `searchOptions` parameter for setting search tokens. The `searchOptions` parameter includes the following attributes:

* `searchTokenString`
+
A TML query string to define search tokens.

* `executeSearch`
+
When set to `true`, it executes search and shows the search results.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag redBackground]#DEPRECATED# a| +++<h5>searchQuery</h5>+++

The `searchQuery` parameter in the `searchEmbed` SDK package is deprecated in the Visual Embed SDK version 1.3.1. Instead, you can use the `searchOptions` parameter to define the search token string.

For more information about `searchOptions`, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>autoLogin</h5>+++

The SDK now supports logging in users automatically after a user session has expired.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>shouldEncodeUrlQueryParams</h5>+++

You can now convert query parameters in the ThoughtSpot generated URLs to base64-encoded format. You can enable this attribute to secure your cluster from cross-site scripting attacks.
|[tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE# a| +++<h5>Data structure changes in custom action response payloads</h5>+++

* The  data structure passed in the custom action response for search now shows as `payload.data.embedAnswerData` instead of `payload.data.columnsAndData`.

* The Answer payload for custom actions includes the following metadata:

** `reportBookmetadata`
+
Includes visualization metadata attributes such as description, object header metadata, author details, timestamp of the Answer creation, and modification.

** user data
+
Includes user information such as username, GUID of the user, and email address.

To view a sample response payload, see xref:callback-response-payload.adoc#search-data-payload[Custom action response payload].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>preventPinboardFilterRemoval</h5>+++

The `pinboardEmbed` SDK package now includes the `preventPinboardFilterRemoval` attribute. You can use this attribute to disable the filter removal action and thus prevent users from removing the filter chips added on a pinboard page.

For more information, see xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a pinboard] and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization].
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>suppressNoCookieAccessAlert</h5>+++

You can now set custom alerts for `noCookieAccess` events. By default, the SDK triggers a `noCookieAccess` event and generates an alert when a user's browser blocks third-party cookies. The `suppressNoCookieAccessAlert` allows you to disable this alert.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>Support for fetching callback custom action payload in batches</h5>+++

The Visual Embed SDK now supports processing data in batches for callback custom action responses.
The callback custom action event in the SDK package supports defining `batchSize` and `offset` values to paginate the Answer payload and send the records in batches.

For more information, see xref:push-data-to-external-app.adoc#large-dataset[Callback custom action workflow].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>SAML authentication</h5>+++

The Visual Embed SDK packages now include the `noRedirect` attribute as an optional parameter for  the SAMLRedirect SSO `AuthType`. If you want to display the SAML authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see the instructions for embedding xref:full-embed.adoc[ThoughtSpot pages], xref:embed-search.adoc[search], xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[pinboard], and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE#  a|+++<h5>NoCookieAccess event</h5>+++

When a user accesses the embedded application from a web browser that has third-party cookies disabled, the Visual Embed SDK emits the `NoCookieAccess` event to notify the developer. Cookies are disabled by default in Safari. Users can enable third-party cookies in Safari’s Preferences setting page or use another web browser.
To know how to enable this setting by default on Safari for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
