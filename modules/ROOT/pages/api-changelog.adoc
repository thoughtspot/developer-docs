+
* `Action.DownloadAsCsv`

For more information, see xref:css-customization.adoc[Customize CSS].
|[tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE# a|The new Liveboard experience mode introduces changes to the data format of the JSON response payload triggered by callback custom actions. For example, the `reportBookData`, and `vizData` attributes are modified, and the custom action `id` now is part of the data attribute. These changes may break your current custom action event handlers. For interoperability, we recommend adding the data attribute to `payload` in your code as shown in the example here:

[source,JavaScript]

----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, payload => {
    if (payload.id === "callback-action-id" \|\| payload.data.id === "callback-action-id") {
        console.log('Custom Action event:', payload.data);
    }
})
----

You may also want to update the data classes in your scripts to process the JSON response payload and handle complex data. For more information, see xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc#_define_functions_and_classes_to_handle_liveboard_data[Callback custom actions].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|The new version of the SDK introduces the following Host events:

* `HostEvent.Share`
* `HostEvent.ShowUnderlyingData`
* `HostEvent.SpotIQAnalyze`
* `HostEvent.SyncToOtherApps`
* `HostEvent.SyncToSheets`

For more information, see xref:embed-events.adoc#host-events[Host events].

|[tag redBackground]#DEPRECATED# a|The `noRedirect` property in the SDK is deprecated and replaced with the `inPopup` attribute. When set to `true`, the `inPopup` attribute allows the SAML SSO authentication flow in a pop-up window.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc#_saml_redirection[SAML Redirection].

For more information, see xref:css-customization.adoc[Customize CSS].
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# |The new version of the SDK allows fetching TML objects via `GetTML` host event. This event is triggered when a user clicks on the *Show underlying data* action on a Liveboard visualization or Answer page. +

For more information, see xref:HostEvent.adoc#_gettml[GetTML].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| The new version of the SDK introduces the following enums in the `Action` object:

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++Prefetch API+++</h5>+++

The `prefetch` API fetches static resources from a given URL before your application loads. Web browsers can then cache the prefetched resources locally and serve them from a user's local disk. You can use this API to load the embedded objects faster and improve your application response time.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++In-app page navigation+++</h5>+++

The `navigateToPage` method in the SDK lets you provide quick and direct access to a specific pinboard, saved Answer, or an application page. You can add a custom menu action or button in your application UI that calls the `navigateToPage` method and leads your users to the page specified in the `path` parameter.

For more information, see xref:page-navigation.adoc[Add a custom action for in-app navigation].
