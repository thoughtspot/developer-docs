:page-description: Understanding how to use the theme builder

Theme builder is built to provide developers the graphical control of the CSS customization options available with the Visual Embed SDK. The developers
can explore the styles and get a preview of the desired look and feel before applying these CSS elements through the SDK.

You can try out the styles across various embed components, also be able to edit and download the JSON for further use in your ThoughtSpot embed code.
Current list of embed components supported through the Theme builder include Liveboard, Visualizations, Search page, and the full application experience.

The Theme builder playground can be accessed https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/theme-builder[here].
