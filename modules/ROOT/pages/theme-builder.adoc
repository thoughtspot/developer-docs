:page-description: Understanding how to use the theme builder

Theme Builder provides a graphical interface to explore the CSS customization options   that are currently available for various ThoughtSpot components. You can try out these style customization options and get a preview of the desired look and feel before applying these changes to the ThoughtSpot components in your application environment.

In the current version, Theme Builder supports style customization options for embed components such as Liveboard, visualization, Search data page, Spotter and full ThoughtSpot app experience. The Theme Builder playground also provides an option to import and export CSS variables with custom values in JSON format.
