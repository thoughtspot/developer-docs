:page-description: Understanding how to use the Theme Builder

Theme Builder provides a graphical interface to explore and preview CSS customization options for various ThoughtSpot components. You can adjust style settings and view the changes in real time before applying them to embedded ThoughtSpot components, such as Liveboard, Visualization, Search, Spotter, and full application experience. Theme Builder also allows you to import and export CSS variables with custom values in JSON format.

When Theme Builder is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, you can access it by navigating to  *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Theme Builder*.
You can also access it from in-product help by clicking *Guides* > *Live Playgrounds* > *Theme Builder* in the ThoughtSpot UI.
