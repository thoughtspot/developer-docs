:page-description: Use SpotterCode to accelerate code generation and the process of embedding and integrating ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot’s SpotterCode is an AI-powered acceleration tool that streamlines and speeds up the process of embedding and integrating ThoughtSpot analytics.

== What is SpotterCode?
SpotterCode connects your integrated development environment (IDE) to a ThoughtSpot-hosted MCP server. It enhances AI-native IDEs with tools and documentation lookup capabilities, providing direct access to ThoughtSpot SDK, API documentation, and code samples. The AI agents in the IDE can use these skills to assist developers in embedding ThoughtSpot content and integrating REST API workflows into their applications.

[IMPORTANT]
====
SpotterCode is an add-on acceleration tool available with the link:https://www.thoughtspot.com/pricing[ThoughtSpot Analytics and ThoughtSpot Embedded offerings, window=_blank]. If you have a ThoughtSpot Analytics license with an active ThoughtSpot Embedded subscription, you can integrate SpotterCode into your IDE using the SpotterCode MCP Server URL.
====

== Who can use SpotterCode
SpotterCode is intended for developers and technical teams embedding ThoughtSpot into their applications using the SDK or REST APIs, particularly those working in AI-native IDEs such as Cursor.

When integrated, SpotterCode offers the following advantages:

* Empowers your IDE with the documentation lookup and provides direct access to authoritative information and guidance required for embedding ThoughtSpot or integrating REST API workflows in your development projects.

* Accelerates the process of embedding and integration by providing code generation, SDK skills, and custom styling directly in the IDE.

* Enables developers to build context-aware and deployment-ready code tailored to their project structure, thereby reducing manual effort and errors.

* Reduces operational strain by rapidly generating boilerplate code for embedding ThoughtSpot in your application.

[NOTE]
====
SpotterCode is an acceleration tool designed to help developers streamline the process of integrating ThoughtSpot into their projects. It does not replace the Visual Embed SDK or the foundational knowledge required for embedding or application integration.
====

== Supported IDEs

The initial version of SpotterCode supports the following IDEs:

* Cursor AI
* Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot
* Claude Code

== Supported skills
SpotterCode provides the following skills to the AI agent on your IDE:

* `get-visual-embed-sdk-reference` +
A documentation lookup skill that accesses Visual Embed SDK documentation and generates code samples for embedding ThoughtSpot content, including supported embed types, authentication, configuration, customization, event hooks, and code samples.

* `get-rest-api-reference` +
Provides REST API specifications, endpoints, request/response formats, authentication flows, CRUD operations, and SDKs for TypeScript and Java.

* `get-developer-docs-reference` +
Provides access to documentation on embedding, UI customization, deployment, security, and best practices.

== Limitations

* SpotterCode’s capabilities are limited to the features and parameters exposed by the current Visual Embed SDK, REST API, and ThoughtSpot Developer documentation.
* SpotterCode helps in generating code samples for the most common use cases. Development scenarios that require deeper customization and have highly specialized use cases may require manual intervention or additional coding.
