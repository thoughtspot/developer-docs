:page-description: This document describes how to install, configure, and use SpotterCode in supported IDEs such as Cursor.

SpotterCode brings ThoughtSpot’s Spotter AI and analytics code generation directly into developer Integrated development environments (IDE)s such as Cursor. When integrated with an IDE, it streamlines the embedding process, enables rapid and context-aware integration of ThoughtSpot analytics using SDKs and APIs.

== Overview
SpotterCode is a server-side integration layer that connects ThoughtSpot Analytics with IDEs through an MCP server. It exposes a set of tools and skills for code generation, style customization, and SDK documentation access and makes these skills available to developers within the IDE. Developers can use these capabilities to obtain information, code examples, and assistance for embedding and deploying ThoughtSpot content in their applications.
SpotterCode leverages the agentic capabilities of the IDE to enable automatic code scaffolding that fits your project’s context and structure, be it for embedding in a new and existing application.

SpotterCode is hosted by ThoughtSpot and easy to integrate with your IDE. Developers can choose the skills to use and automate code logic just by sending messages in natural language in the Cursor chat session.

=== Key features
SpotterCode is designed to help developers build their embed code with ease with the following capabilities:

* Ability to directly access ThoughtSpot's Visual Embed SDK documentation, CSS customization framework, and code samples from the cursor IDE to generate embed code, configure embed view and customize styles for embedded ThoughtSpot pages.
* Ability to support prompts with natural language queries and instructions in Cursor to generate embed pages with ThoughtSpot content, including Liveboards, full application experience, answers, and more.
* Ability to parse user request, determine required parameters such as the host URL and automatically insert these into your projects, and render your app.
* Ability to automatically generate and insert the code into your project, hande the integration errors, and embed ThoughtSpot components.

=== Supported IDEs

The initial version of SpotterCode supports the following IDEs:

* Cursor
* <others>

=== Supported MCP tools and skills
When the SpotterCode MCP server is integrated with your IDE, the following skills are exposed to the AI agent on your IDE.

* `get-sdk-docs` +
Searches and retrieves documentation for ThoughtSpot SDKs, including Visual Embed SDK and REST API SDK. The agent on your IDE uses this skill to get responses for user questions related to embedding, authentication options, customization settings, and REST APIs.  For example, when a user sends a natural language question about embedding ThoughtSpot, the AI agent on your IDE programmatically determines the `query` string and documentation `type`, invokes the `get-sdk-docs` skill, and returns responses from the Visual Embed SDK documentation.

* `get-code-example` +
Retrieves code example from ThoughtSpot SDKs. For example, when a user asks question on embedding Liveboard, the AI agent on your IDE determines the context programmatically and invokes `get-code-example` skill to retrieve code examples for embedding a Liveboard.

* `get-style-customization` +
Provides theming, styling, and customization guidance for ThoughtSpot UI and embeds. Supports changing colors, fonts, backgrounds, branding, and other visual elements using CSS variables, theme JSON, or the Visual Embed SDK. The skill can generate official `CustomVariables` code and styling examples for LiveBoard, Search, and Visualization embeds. This skill supports text queries, branding guidelines in PDF, and design mockup image and PDF.
+
For example, when a user sends instructions to change the button or background color of the embedded page, the AI agent on your IDE invokes this `get-style-customization` skill to generate the code with variables supported in the ThoughtSpot's CSS customization framework. If the user's instruction is match your host app's style, the theme properties and values are extracted from your codebase and applied to your embed.

==== Input schema of the skills

The input schema for the SpotterCode skills consists of the following parameters. Note that the values for these parameters are context-driven and are programmatically added by the AI agent orchestrating the workflows in your IDE.

* `query` +
A free-form string describing the user's request or question. This is used to determine the context and intent of the skill invocation.
* `type` +
An optional attribute, but commonly used to specify the category of information passed in the query. For example, when a user asks a question or passes instructions in natural language to embed a Liveboard, the `query` string is determined based on the context and user's intent and the `get-sdk-docs` skill is invoked to return responses for the `visual-embed-sdk` type.

* `appThemeContext` +
This parameter in the `get-style-customization` input schema is used when a user sends the instruction to match the app's theme. It is an optional object containing extracted theme values such as `computedStyles`, `cssVariables`, `designTokens`, and `additionalContext`.

=== How it works

. A user starts a chat session with the IDE and asks a question seeking information or help with a specific action.
. The AI agent interprets the user's natural language input and maps it to the appropriate skill.
. The agent constructs a structured MCP request, populating the input schema parameters such as `query`, `type`, `appThemeContext`.
. The MCP skill uses the query to search documentation, provide customization guidance and code examples.
. The AI agent receives the results, and provides them back to the model, which generates the final response for the user.
