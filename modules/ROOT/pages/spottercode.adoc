:page-description: Use SpotterCode to accelerate code generation and the process of embedding and integrating ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot’s SpotterCode is an AI-powered MCP tool that streamlines and speeds up the process of embedding ThoughtSpot content and integrating ThoughtSpot REST APIs in your application workflows.

== What is SpotterCode?
SpotterCode connects your integrated development environment (IDE) to a ThoughtSpot-hosted MCP server. It empowers AI-native IDEs with tools and documentation lookup capabilities, providing direct access to ThoughtSpot SDKs, REST API documentation, code samples, and developer guides. The AI agents in the IDE can use these skills to assist developers in embedding ThoughtSpot content and integrating REST API workflows into their applications.

[IMPORTANT]
====
SpotterCode is an add-on tool available with the link:https://www.thoughtspot.com/pricing[ThoughtSpot Analytics and ThoughtSpot Embedded offerings, window=_blank]. If you have a ThoughtSpot Analytics license with an active ThoughtSpot Embedded subscription, you can integrate SpotterCode using the SpotterCode MCP Server URL in your coding application.
====

== Who should use SpotterCode?
SpotterCode is intended for developers and technical teams integrating ThoughtSpot content and workflows into their applications using Visual Embed SDK and REST APIs, with a particular focus on those working in AI-native IDEs such as Cursor.

When integrated, SpotterCode offers the following advantages:

* Empowers your IDE with the documentation lookup and provides direct access to authoritative information on embedding ThoughtSpot or integrating REST API workflows in your development projects.

* Accelerates the process of embedding and integration by providing code samples, SDK skills, and custom styling directly in the IDE.

* Enables developers to build context-aware and deployment-ready code tailored to their project structure, thereby reducing manual effort and errors.

* Reduces operational strain by rapidly generating boilerplate code required for embedding ThoughtSpot in your application.

[NOTE]
====
SpotterCode is an acceleration tool designed to help developers streamline the process of integrating ThoughtSpot into their projects. It does not replace the Visual Embed SDK or the foundational knowledge required for embedding or application integration.

== Supported IDEs

The initial version of SpotterCode supports the following IDEs:

* Cursor AI
* Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot
* Claude Code

== Supported skills
SpotterCode provides the following skills to the AI agent on your IDE:

* `get-visual-embed-sdk-reference` +
A documentation lookup skill that accesses Visual Embed SDK documentation and generates code samples for embedding ThoughtSpot content, including supported embed types, authentication, configuration, customization, event hooks, and code samples.

* `get-rest-api-reference` +
Provides REST API specifications, endpoints, request/response formats, authentication flows, CRUD operations, and SDKs for TypeScript and Java.

* `get-developer-docs-reference` +
Provides access to documentation on embedding, UI customization, deployment, security, and best practices.

== Limitations

- Responses from SpotterCode are determined by the features and parameters currently supported in the Visual Embed SDK, REST API, and official ThoughtSpot Developer documentation. SpotterCode cannot generate code or solutions that rely on unsupported or undocumented features.
- SpotterCode can generate code samples for the most common use cases. Scenarios that require advanced customization or highly specialized workflows may require manual intervention or additional coding beyond what SpotterCode provides.
- SpotterCode does not influence how the Spotter feature in your ThoughtSpot embed infers semantic modeling. SpotterCode is not intended for querying data models or interpreting definitions such as measures and attributes in your metadata objects.
- The behavior of the IDE agent, including tool selection and reasoning, is not controlled by SpotterCode.
