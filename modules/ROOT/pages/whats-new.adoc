== Version 9.4.0.cl

.Version control and Git integration [beta betaBackground]^Beta^
[%collapsible]
====
GUID mapping::

If a TML file on your source environment contains GUIDs that don't match the GUIDs on your destination environment, the version control APIs can now automatically handle the mapping of GUIDs when deploying the TML content.

+
For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_guid_mapping[Git integration and version control].

Folder structure changes [tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE#::

The folder structure of the TML objects in the Git repository is modified in 9.4.0.cl. In earlier releases, the TML objects were stored in the object directory of the `primary` root folder, for example `primary/liveboard`. Starting from 9.4.0.cl, the TML objects will be stored in the object folder at the root level. ThoughtSpot will not migrate your existing TML files from `primary/<object-dir>` to the new folder structure. You must move these files to the respective object directory at the root level.

File naming convention [tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE#::
Starting from 9.4.0.cl, the TML files pushed to a Git branch from a ThoughtSpot instance are named in the
`<object-name>.<guid>.tml` format. The earlier releases used the `<guid>.<object-name>.tml` naming convention for TML files. This change may break your current setup. We recommend that you reconfigure the Git connection on your ThoughtSpot instance and start using the version control feature from scratch.

[NOTE]
The Cross filters feature is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your instance, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.

To hide or disable the cross filter feature on an embedded instance, use the `Action.CrossFilter` and `Action.RemoveCrossFilter` parameters in the SDK. For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Show or hide menu items] and xref:Action.adoc[Action reference].
[discrete]
=== Contextual menu behavior

By default, the contextual menu in ThoughtSpot application pages is set as right-click pop-up menu. Starting from 9.2.0.cl, you can set the contextual menu to trigger on left-click.

To trigger the contextual menu on left-click or right-click on an embedded app, you can use the `contextMenuTrigger` property in the Visual Embed SDK. In the following example, the contextual menu is configured to trigger on left-click.

----
contextMenuTrigger: "left-click"
----

----
contextMenuTrigger: ContextMenuTriggerOptions.LEFT_CLICK
----

When set as right-click menu (default behavior)::
The contextual menu opens on right-click. If you want to monitor right-click actions and listen to the right-click events on a chart or table, use `EmbedEvent.VizPointRightClick` event. For more information, see xref:events-ref.adoc#_vizpointrightclick[VizPointRightClick].

When set as left-click menu::
The contextual menu opens on left-click. If your app is already using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to listen to left-click events on a visualization, the `VizPointClick` event will be triggered whenever a user clicks on an action in the contextual menu. If you are using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to trigger actions such as updating runtime filters on a Liveboard visualization, the click events from left-click contextual menu may impact your appâ€™s current workflow.

+
We recommend using a development environment to test your customizations before rolling them out on production servers. For more information, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

.Improvements to authentication methods and AuthType enums in the SDK
[%collapsible]
====
The following changes are introduced in the Visual Embed SDK to improve the authentication framework and options for embedded application users:

* New auth type enum for embedded SSO authentication
+
The `AuthType.EmbeddedSSO` enum allows you to enable SSO login on embedded instances. This authentication method allows you to use your current SAML IdP or OpenID Connect configuration and redirect users to the IdP for authentication within the embedded iFrame.

* Changes to the existing `AuthType` enums: +
** `AuthType.SAML` is renamed as `AuthType.SAMLRedirect` +
** `AuthType.OIDC` is renamed as `AuthType.OIDCRedirect` +
** `AuthType.AuthServer` is renamed to `AuthType.TrustedAuthToken` +

.Liveboard new experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^
[%collapsible]
====
The new Liveboard experience is now available on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. In addition to the existing Liveboard features, the new experience introduces several notable changes to the *Liveboard* page:

Liveboard editing::
To edit a Liveboard, users must switch to the edit mode by clicking the *Edit* button on the Liveboard page.
The edit mode allows you to edit the Liveboard title and description text, apply filters, copy the Liveboard, modify the layout of the visualization tiles, delete a visualization, and so on.

Liveboard filters::
* The Liveboard filter configuration options are available on a single modal.
* When a user creates a copy of a Liveboard, the filters applied to its visualizations are also copied.

Other features and enhancements::
* The *Add filters* action is placed in the primary menu bar and can be viewed only when a Liveboard is in edit mode. Only users with edit access to the Liveboard can apply filters.
* The *Undo*, *Redo*, and *Reset* actions for visualizations.
* The *Liveboard Info* action label in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu is renamed to *Show Liveboard details*.
* The *Schedule* action is placed in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
* Improved visualization Explore experience.

Deprecated features::
The following features are *_not_* available with the new Liveboard experience:
* The *Copy embed link* and *Copy link* menu actions in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu of a Liveboard
* The edit title icon on visualization tiles
* The *Share* button on visualizations

[discrete]
==== New Liveboard experience rollout on embedded instances

The new Liveboard experience is currently available in BETA on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. The new liveboard experience will be rolled out on embedded instances in phases:

In ThoughtSpot Cloud 8.6.0.cl::

The new Liveboard experience is turned off by default on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. If you are using the Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot, you can xref:embed-pinboard.adoc#lbv2[set the `liveboardV2` parameter] in the SDK package to `true` and enable the new experience globally for all users on your instance. +

+
ThoughtSpot users with administrator privileges can also link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-experience-new[turn on the new Liveboard experience, window=_blank] at the cluster level.

In later releases::
The new Liveboard Experience will be turned on by default for all embed application users. To switch to the classic experience, you can set the `liveboardV2` parameter to `false` in the SDK, or change the Liveboard experience preference in the `Admin` tab of the ThoughtSpot UI.

[NOTE]
The Liveboard experience setting in the SDK takes precedence over the cluster-level settings in the *Admin* tab.

[discrete]
==== Actions and Events in the SDK
If you have enabled the new Liveboard experience on your instance, you can use the `Action` and `Event` enumeration members available in the SDK package to customize an embedded object and improve interactivity.

For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum. Similarly, you can trigger events such as  `VizPointClick`  on visualizations in an embedded Liveboard.

Effective from the ThoughtSpot 8 November Cloud release, ThoughtSpot pinboards are rebranded as Liveboards and optimized for live analytics in cloud deployments. Along with granular insights, Liveboards offer interactive data analytics experience with enhanced capabilities.

As part of rebranding, we have made some terminology changes in the ThoughtSpot UI and Developer portal. We are in the process of rolling out terminology changes across all ThoughtSpot interfaces, platforms, and information artifacts. During this period, your environment may show some instances of `pinboard` based on the rebranding rollout stage.

The `searchEmbed` SDK package introduces the `searchOptions` parameter for setting search tokens. The `searchOptions` parameter includes the following attributes:

* `searchTokenString`
+
A TML query string to define search tokens.

* `executeSearch`
+
When set to `true`, it executes search and shows the search results.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag redBackground]#DEPRECATED# a| +++<h5>searchQuery</h5>+++

The `searchQuery` parameter in the `searchEmbed` SDK package is deprecated in the Visual Embed SDK version 1.3.1. Instead, you can use the `searchOptions` parameter to define the search token string.

For more information about `searchOptions`, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>autoLogin</h5>+++

The SDK now supports logging in users automatically after a user session has expired.

|[tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE# a| +++<h5>Data structure changes in custom action response payloads</h5>+++

* The  data structure passed in the custom action response for search now shows as `payload.data.embedAnswerData` instead of `payload.data.columnsAndData`.

* The Answer payload for custom actions includes the following metadata:

** `reportBookmetadata`
+
Includes visualization metadata attributes such as description, object header metadata, author details, timestamp of the Answer creation, and modification.

** user data
+
Includes user information such as username, GUID of the user, and email address.

To view a sample response payload, see xref:callback-response-payload.adoc#search-data-payload[Custom action response payload].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>preventPinboardFilterRemoval</h5>+++

The `pinboardEmbed` SDK package now includes the `preventPinboardFilterRemoval` attribute. You can use this attribute to disable the filter removal action and thus prevent users from removing the filter chips added on a pinboard page.

For more information, see xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a pinboard] and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization].
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>suppressNoCookieAccessAlert</h5>+++

You can now set custom alerts for `noCookieAccess` events. By default, the SDK triggers a `noCookieAccess` event and generates an alert when a user's browser blocks third-party cookies. The `suppressNoCookieAccessAlert` allows you to disable this alert.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a| +++<h5>Support for fetching callback custom action payload in batches</h5>+++

The Visual Embed SDK now supports processing data in batches for callback custom action responses.
The callback custom action event in the SDK package supports defining `batchSize` and `offset` values to paginate the Answer payload and send the records in batches.

.Custom actions
[%collapsible]
====

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Global and local custom actions</h5>+++

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports configuring a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations, or a specific custom action that can be added to a visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. The custom actions panel in the visualization page allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Authentication schemes for custom actions</h5>+++

You can now apply an authentication scheme for a custom action that triggers a data payload to a specific URL target. If an action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.
ThoughtSpot will use this information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|
+++<h5>Custom action position settings</h5>+++

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

.Custom link format for embedded instances
[%collapsible]
====

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].
