:page-description: New features and enhancements

This page provides information about new features, enhancements, and deprecated functionality in ThoughtSpot Everywhere.

== Version 9.3.0.cl

=== Support for cookieless authentication

Developers can now enable cookieless authentication when embedding ThoughtSpot in their applications. The cookieless authentication method allows using a bearer token instead of session cookies when users interact with embedded content or initiate API requests. If the embedded content does not load from the same domain as your embedding application, and your Web browser does not allow third-party cookies, you can use Cookieless authentication in the Trusted authentication mode.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-embed[Trusted authentication].

=== Idle sensing and APIs for managing cluster states

ThoughtSpot Cloud clusters support idle sensing in embedded deployments. With idle sensing enabled on your embedded ThoughtSpot instance, your instance becomes inactive if there is no active user session detected for a period of 120 minutes. You can restart an inactive cluster using API when required.

For more information, see xref:tse-eco-mode.adoc[Manage your cluster state].

=== Per-Org style customization

The *Develop* tab now allows customizing UI styles and layout at the Org level. To enable this feature on your multi-tenant instance, contact ThoughtSpot support.

////
===  Version control APIs for GIT workflows

=== New features and enhancements to the new Liveboard experience

////

=== Visual Embed Playground enhancements

The Visual Embed developer Playground now includes a *Try* button in the preview panel. The *Try* button is attached to an event handler, using which you can try out host events in the SDK to trigger an action in the embed mode.

For more information, see xref:events-ref.adoc#host-events[Events reference].

=== Visual Embed SDK

For information about the new features and enhancements introduced in Visual Embed SDK versions 1.22.0, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed changelog].

=== REST API

For information about REST API enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv1-changelog.adoc[REST API v1 changelog] and xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc[REST API v2.0 changelog].

== Version 9.2.0.cl

=== Per-Org secret key and tokens for Trusted authentication

ThoughtSpot now supports generating secret keys per Org. Org administrators can generate a secret key for trusted authentication in their Org context and allow their Org users to obtain authentication tokens using this secret key.

Starting from 9.2.0.cl, Org users require Org-specific authentication tokens issued for their user accounts when switching between Orgs. When generating an authentication token via REST API, make sure to request separate tokens for each Org context.

For more information, see xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[Trusted authentication].

=== Custom styles

The 9.2.0.cl release introduces the following new variables for custom styling of the ThoughtSpot Search page:

* `--ts-var-search-auto-complete-font-color`
* `--ts-var-search-auto-complete-subtext-font-color`
* `--ts-var-answer-edit-panel-background-color`

For more information, see xref:css-customization.adoc#_search_bar_and_data_panel[Customize CSS].

=== GraphQL playground [beta betaBackground]^Beta^
The *Develop* tab in the ThoughtSpot UI introduces the GraphQL playground to allow users to interact with GraphQL endpoints and run query and mutation operations. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

For more information, see xref:graphql-playground.adoc[GraphQL Playground].

=== Runtime Parameter overrides

Embedded application users can now create Worksheet and Answer Parameters to optimize data queries. You can also adjust values and apply overrides at runtime on a Liveboard or Answer either via REST API or by appending Parameters to the query URL in the UI.

For more information, see xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[Runtime Parameter overrides].

[NOTE]
====
In the 9.2.0.cl release, ThoughtSpot does not support applying runtime Parameter overrides via Visual Embed SDK or REST API v2.0 endpoints.
====

=== Link customization

You can now customize the navigation links in your app using the *Generic link* option in the *Develop* > *Customization* > *Link settings* page.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc#_customize_link_format[Customize links].

=== Cross filters on Liveboard visualizations [eaTag eaBackground]#Early Access#

ThoughtSpot now supports brushing and linking of visualizations on a Liveboard using cross filters. Cross filters allow you to present a coordinated view of a Liveboard by applying filters across all visualizations based on the current selection.

[NOTE]
====
The Cross filters feature is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your instance, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.
====

To hide or disable the cross filter feature on an embedded instance, use the `Action.CrossFilter` and `Action.RemoveCrossFilter` parameters in the SDK. For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Show or hide menu items] and xref:embed-action-ref.adoc#liveboardv2-viz-actions[Action reference].

=== Contextual menu behavior

By default, the contextual menu in ThoughtSpot application pages is set as right-click pop-up menu. Starting from 9.2.0.cl, you can set the contextual menu to trigger on left-click.

To trigger the contextual menu on left-click or right-click on an embedded app, you can use the `contextMenuTrigger` property in the Visual Embed SDK. In the following example, the contextual menu is configured to trigger on left-click.

----
contextMenuTrigger: "left-click"
----

----
contextMenuTrigger: ContextMenuTriggerOptions.LEFT_CLICK
----

When set as right-click menu (default behavior)::
The contextual menu opens on right-click. If you want to monitor right-click actions and listen to the right-click events on a chart or table, use `EmbedEvent.VizPointRightClick` event. For more information, see xref:events-ref.adoc#_vizpointrightclick[VizPointRightClick].

When set as left-click menu::
The contextual opens on left-click. If your app is already using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to listen to left-click events on a visualization, the `VizPointClick` event will be triggered whenever a user clicks on an action in the contextual menu. If you are using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to trigger actions such as updating runtime filters on a Liveboard visualization, the click events from left-click contextual menu may impact your appâ€™s current workflow.

+
We recommend using a development environment to test your customizations before rolling them out on production servers. For more information, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

=== Note tiles on Liveboards [eaTag eaBackground]#Early Access#

In the new Liveboard experience mode, you can now add Note tiles with custom text, images, and links. This feature is turned off by default and can be enabled by ThoughtSpot administrators.

For more information, see xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc#noteTiles[Note tiles].

=== Visual Embed SDK

For information about the new features and enhancements introduced in Visual Embed SDK versions 1.20.0 and 1.21.0, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed changelog].

=== REST API

For information about REST API enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv1-changelog.adoc[REST API v1 changelog] and xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc[REST API v2.0 changelog].

.REST API v2.0 endpoints and Playground
[%collapsible]
====
Starting with 9.0.0.cl, the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ API endpoints are deprecated and removed from the REST API v2 Playground. A set of new endpoints are now generally available (GA) on all ThoughtSpot instances.

The new REST API v2.0 endpoints introduce several improvements to the request and response structure and let you perform more tasks in a single API call. For example, you can create a new user, map the user to groups and Orgs, set home Liveboards for the user, and assign privileges in a single API request.

[div announcementBlock]
--
* All REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints are deprecated, but remain functional until further notice. The REST API SDK that was available with REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version is no longer supported. +
ThoughtSpot does not recommend using REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints for production use cases. For more information, see xref:deprecated-features.adoc#_deprecation_of_rest_v2_api[Deprecation announcements].
* The new REST API v2.0 endpoints are not an extension of the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints. The resource categories, base path, endpoint URIs, and the structure of API requests and responses are different from those of the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version.
* Some API operations such as the CRUD operations for data connections and passing runtime filters on Liveboard visualizations are not available in the initial release. For more information, see xref:rest-api-v1v2-comparison.adoc[REST API v1 and v2.0 comparison] and xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc[REST API v2.0 reference].

[discrete]
==== New Liveboard experience rollout on embedded instances

The new Liveboard experience is currently available in BETA on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. The new liveboard experience will be rolled out on embedded instances in phases:

In ThoughtSpot Cloud 8.6.0.cl::
The new Liveboard experience is turned off by default on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. If you are using the Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot, you can xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc[set the `liveboardV2` parameter] in the SDK package to `true` and enable the new experience globally for all users on your instance. +
+
ThoughtSpot users with administrator privileges can also link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-experience-new[turn on the new Liveboard experience, window=_blank] at the cluster level.

In later releases::
The new Liveboard Experience will be turned on by default for all embed application users. To switch to the classic experience, you can set the `liveboardV2` parameter to `false` in the SDK, or change the Liveboard experience preference in the `Admin` tab of the ThoughtSpot UI.

[NOTE]
The Liveboard experience setting in the SDK takes precedence over the cluster-level settings in the *Admin* tab.

[discrete]
==== Actions and Events in the SDK
If you have enabled the new Liveboard experience on your instance, you can use the `Action` and `Event` enumeration members available in the SDK package to customize an embedded object and improve interactivity.

For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum. Similarly, you can trigger events such as  `VizPointClick`  on visualizations in an embedded Liveboard.

Effective from the ThoughtSpot 8 November Cloud release, ThoughtSpot pinboards are rebranded as Liveboards and optimized for live analytics in cloud deployments. Along with granular insights, Liveboards offer interactive data analytics experience with enhanced capabilities.

As part of rebranding, we have made some terminology changes in the ThoughtSpot UI and Developer portal. We are in the process of rolling out terminology changes across all ThoughtSpot interfaces, platforms, and information artifacts. During this period, your environment may show some instances of `pinboard` based on the rebranding rollout stage. In some cases, we may even continue to use the legacy terminology for backward compatibility, and to ensure that your existing integrations work seamlessly.

Starting from ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud October release, you _do not_ require a separate ThoughtSpot Everywhere Edition license to create or manage custom actions. The *Custom action* feature is unlocked on all clusters that have a valid ThoughtSpot Enterprise Cloud service subscription. ThoughtSpot Cloud service users with Developer or Admin privileges can access the *Custom actions* feature in the *Develop* tab.

|[tag redBackground]#REMOVED# a|+++<h5>The Only allow in context menu checkbox</<h5> +++

The *Only allow in context menu* checkbox in the custom action creation dialog is removed from the UI. This checkbox was available in previous releases to allow developers to set a custom action to appear only in the contextual menu on pinboard visualizations, charts, or tables.

If you have created custom actions with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled on your instance, note these custom action workflow changes:

* If you have a *Global* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled, the configuration setting _is not_ preserved and the action is placed in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu instead of the contextual menu.

You can xref:custom-actions-edit.adoc[modify the position of this action] by using the *Edit* option in the *Custom actions* panel on a visualization or search results page.

* If you have a *Local* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled and the action is already assigned to a Worksheet, visualization, chart, or table, the configuration setting _is_ preserved and the custom action shows up in the contextual menu.

* If you have a *Local* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled, but it is not assigned to a Worksheet, visualization, chart, or table, the action will not be available as a menu item or button. You must add the action to a visualization, chart, or table, and configure its position as required.

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Global and local custom actions</h5>+++

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports configuring a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations, or a specific custom action that can be added to a visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. The custom actions panel in the visualization page allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Authentication schemes for custom actions</h5>+++

You can now apply an authentication scheme for a custom action that triggers a data payload to a specific URL target. If an action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.
ThoughtSpot will use this information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|
+++<h5>Custom action position settings</h5>+++

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>SAML authentication</h5>+++

The Visual Embed SDK packages now include the `noRedirect` attribute as an optional parameter for  the `SSO` `AuthType`. If you want to display the SAML authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see the instructions for embedding xref:full-embed.adoc[ThoughtSpot pages], xref:embed-search.adoc[search], xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[pinboard], and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE#  a|+++<h5>Visual Embed SDK notification when third-party cookies are disabled</h5>+++

When a user accesses the embedded application from a web browser that has third-party cookies disabled, the Visual Embed SDK emits the `NoCookieAccess` event to notify the developer. Cookies are disabled by default in Safari. Users can enable third-party cookies in Safariâ€™s Preferences setting page or use another web browser.
To know how to enable this setting by default on Safari for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
