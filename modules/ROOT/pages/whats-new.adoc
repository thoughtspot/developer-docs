:page-description: New features and enhancements

This page lists new features, enhancements, and deprecated functionality in ThoughtSpot Embedded instances.

== Version 10.14.0.cl

=== Code based custom actions
ThoughtSpot now enables developers to define custom action in their embed code through the Visual Embed SDK. This enhancement enables code based customization of actions for Liveboards, Visualizations, Answers, and Spotter.  With this functionality, developers can add custom actions that show up as new menu options in one of the following UI elements:

* the primary menu bar
* the **More** options menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]
* the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or visualization +

Code based custom actions:

* Can be maintained within your codebase to facilitate migration across organizations and clusters.
* Can have controlled visibility in ThoughtSpot by evaluating conditions within your application logic. This approach enables you to dynamically display or hide custom actions based on specific criteria, ensuring that only relevant actions are presented to users in different contexts.
* Can also be set for a Liveboard.
* Can be conditionally shown based on the presence of a specific column in a viz.

For more information, see xref:code-based-custom-actions.adoc[Code based custom actions]

=== Webhooks for Liveboard schedule events [beta betaBackground]^Beta^

You can now configure a xref:webhooks-lb-schedule.adoc[webhook for Liveboard schedule events] to automate notifications to external applications. This feature allows you to send Liveboard reports directly to a webhook endpoint, such as your internal marketing or incident management app, at a scheduled frequency. It  eliminates the need to manually process data from email notifications and gives you full control over how the data is handled in your downstream workflows.

This feature is currently in beta and is not enabled by default. To enable it on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support

=== Template variables for publishing
You can now configure formula variables and assign these variables to your metadata. The variable APIs also include several enhancements to streamline variable creation and update workflows.

For more information about the new enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc#_variable_api_enhancements[REST API changelog] and xref:variables.adoc[Variables documentation].

=== Parameter chip visibility configuration [tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE#

The `HostEvent.UpdateParameters` event in the Visual Embed SDK now includes the `isVisibleToUser` attribute, which allows you to control the visibility of Parameter chips on embedded ThoughtSpot pages.

Before this enhancement, the Parameter chip display behavior was inconsistent across embed types when the Parameter values were updated via `HostEvent.UpdateParameters` requests. With the new change, the `isVisibleToUser` attribute in `HostEvent.UpdateParameters` is set to `false` by default for all embed types.

With the new enhancement, the embedded pages that previously kept the parameter chip visible after an override via `HostEvent.UpdateParameters`  will now hide it unless the `isVisibleToUser` attribute is explicitly set to `true`. +
This behavior may introduce a breaking change if your current implementation relies on the previous default chip visibility behavior. To retain chip visibility, developers must update their embedding implementation to pass `isVisibleToUser: true` in their `HostEvent.UpdateParameters` requests.

For more information, see xref:runtime-parameters.adoc#_show_or_hide_parameter_chips_in_embedded_sessions[Runtime Parameter overrides].

=== Visual Embed SDK

For information about the new features and enhancements introduced in Visual Embed SDK version 1.43.0, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed changelog].

=== REST API
For information about REST API v2 enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc[REST API v2.0 changelog].

== Version 10.13.0.cl

=== Spotter AI APIs
ThoughtSpot introduces the following new xref:spotter-apis.adoc[Spotter AI APIs] [beta betaBackground]^Beta^, to provide contextual and agentic capabilities for integration with external clients and custom AI applications:

* `/api/rest/2.0/ai/agent/conversation/create`
* `/api/rest/2.0/ai/data-source-suggestions`
* `/api/rest/2.0/ai/relevant-questions/`
* `/api/rest/2.0/ai/agent/converse/sse`

These APIs are designed to build context with each interaction, orchestrate reasoning, and expose tools and skills for natural language analytics.

The new APIs, such as `/api/rest/2.0/ai/relevant-questions/`, `/api/rest/2.0/ai/agent/converse/sse` and `/api/rest/2.0/ai/data-source-suggestions`, can be accessed both directly and via xref:mcp-integration.adoc[ThoughtSpot's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server].

For more information, see xref:spotter-apis.adoc[Spotter AI APIs].

////
With the introduction of these APIs, the following legacy API endpoints will be deprecated:

* `POST /api/rest/2.0/ai/conversation/create`
* `POST /api/rest/2.0/ai/conversation/{conversation_identifier}/converse`
* `POST /api/rest/2.0/ai/analytical-questions`

The above-listed AI endpoints will be available in the Playground until further notice. However, we recommend using the new APIs for better context management, extensibility, and integration options.
////

=== Support for runtime overrides in Spotter embed
You can apply runtime filters and parameter overrides to Spotter sessions and interactions using the Visual Embed SDK. When these overrides are configured in the SDK, they are applied to the data used for Spotter queries, and the generated answers in these sessions will reflect the applied overrides.

The Visual Embed SDK Playground for Spotter embedding includes an option to set runtime overrides. You can test and preview the results before updating your embed code.

For more information, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters] and xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[Runtime Parameters].

=== Full application embed experience

* The new experience with a sliding navigation panel and modular home page is now available as an Early Access feature for ThoughtSpot embedded application users.
+
The new experience introduces a sliding navigation panel with a persona-based app selector and a modular home page with customizable components. This feature is turned off by default on ThoughtSpot. If this feature is enabled on your instance, you can enable it in full application embed using the `discoveryExperience` SDK property.
+
For more information, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_new_modular_home_page_and_navigation_with_sliding_panel[New navigation and home page experience].

* List pages, such as Answers and Liveboards, now include enhanced sorting and filtering capabilities. These pages also allow users to organize, find, and personalize content. Developers can customize the visibility of columns in their embeds by configuring the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenlistcolumns[`hiddenListColumns`] property in the SDK.
+
For more information, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_hide_columns_on_list_pages_new_experience[Hide columns on List pages].

=== Worksheet deprecation and removal

Worksheets are replaced with Models, and all application workflows will require you to use Models. If you are importing worksheet TMLs, the import operation may fail with an error, requiring users to convert Worksheets to Models. Please update your CI/CD and Git workflows to use Model TMLs instead of Worksheets.

For more information, see xref:deprecated-features.adoc#_worksheet_deprecation_and_removal[Worksheet deprecation].

=== Visual Embed SDK

For information about the new features and enhancements introduced in Visual Embed SDK version 1.42.0, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed changelog].

=== REST API
For information about REST API v2 enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc[REST API v2.0 changelog].

== Version 10.12.0.cl

=== Liveboard grouping and styling [beta betaBackground]^Beta^

You can now create a visual group of Answers and note tiles on an embedded Liveboard and customize the look and feel of the Liveboard, groups, and visualizations using the new styling panel.

The Liveboard styling and grouping feature is disabled by default on embedded apps. To enable this feature on your embed, set `isLiveboardStylingAndGroupingEnabled` to `true` in the SDK and contact ThoughtSpot Support.

When this feature is enabled, you can use the following CSS variables in the Visual Embed SDK to style your Liveboard elements:

* `--ts-var-liveboard-layout-background`
* `--ts-var-liveboard-group-background`
* `--ts-var-liveboard-group-title-font-color`
* `--ts-var-liveboard-group-border-color`
* `--ts-var-liveboard-group-description-font-color`
* `--ts-var-liveboard-group-tile-title-font-color`
* `--ts-var-liveboard-group-tile-description-font-color`

For more information, see xref:customize-css-styles.adoc#grp-style[CSS variables reference].

=== Lazy loading of visualizations on a Liveboard

To optimize initial load time, you can now enable lazy loading of Liveboard visualizations using the `lazyLoadingForFullHeight` parameter. When both `fullHeight` and `lazyLoadingForFullHeight` attributes are set to `true`, visualizations in the embedded Liveboard are loaded incrementally as the user scrolls, rather than all at once on initial load. For more information, see xref:lazy-loading-fullheight.adoc[Lazy loading of Liveboard visualizations].

=== Spotter embed enhancements

Spotter coaching::
Your application users can now coach Spotter based on an ongoing conversation.
The *Add to coaching* feature is turned off by default on ThoughtSpot instances. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

Spotter Agent embedding::
To embed Spotter Agent in a React app, the SDK provides a React component and the `useSpotterAgent` custom React hook. For more information, see xref:embed-ts-react-app.adoc#_embed_spotter_agent_in_your_own_app[Embed Spotter Agent in your React app].

For information about the other SDK enhancements, see xref:_visual_embed_changelog[Visual Embed Changelog].

=== Full application embed
In full application embed, developers can now enable the new navigation panel and home page  experience. The new experience also organizes the application menu into separate persona-based contextual sections. The new interface also provides a slider to allow users to view or hide the left navigation panel.

The new navigation experience is disabled by default and is available for Early Access. To enable this feature on your instance, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator and then configure the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_discoveryexperience[`discovery experience`] property in the SDK.

=== REST API

==== Connection configuration APIs
ThoughtSpot now supports multiple configurations per data Connection. This feature allows data engineers to define and manage several distinct Connection configurations under a single data Connection object in ThoughtSpot. This feature is available only for Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery Cloud Data Warehouses (CDW) connections.

For more information, see xref:connection-config.adoc[Connection Configuration].

==== Custom calendar APIs

You can now create and manage custom calendars for a given Connection object. For more information, see the API documentation in the REST API v2 Playground. For information about REST API v2 enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc[REST API v2.0 changelog].

For information about the new features and enhancements introduced in Visual Embed SDK version 1.41.0, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed changelog].

== Version 10.11.0.cl

=== Spotter embed enhancements

Spotter embed now supports a comprehensive set of embed and host events that enable interaction between the embedded Spotter component and the host application.

Developers can use these events to:

* Listen for key Spotter user interactions and system events, such as downloads, edits, visual changes, and Spotter-specific query responses, by registering handlers for embed events.
* Trigger specific host events from the application to programmatically control actions such as starting a search, resetting the conversation, saving, downloading, and adding Spotter-generated Answers to a Liveboard.

For a complete list of events, see the following pages:

* xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed SDK changelog]
* xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[EmbedEvent]
* xref:HostEvent.adoc[HostEvent]

=== Primary action configuration for Liveboard visualizations

You can now override the action assigned to the primary button that appears on visualization tiles of an embedded Liveboard. The `primaryAction` parameter in the Visual Embed SDK allows developers to set that primary action for the embedded Liveboard visualizations.

For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc#_override_default_primary_actions[Override default primary action].

=== Enhancements to the API response format for Liveboards

The `liveboard_reponse_version` parameter in search metadata (`/api/rest/2.0/metadata/search`) REST API request now allows you to retrieve details of Liveboard tabs, visualizations, and filters in a structured format.

For more information, see xref:rest-api-v2-metadata-search.adoc#_response_format_for_liveboards[Response format for Liveboard objects].

=== Visual Embed SDK

=== REST API
For information about REST API v2 enhancements, see xref:rest-apiv2-changelog.adoc[REST API v2.0 changelog].

== Version 10.10.0.cl

=== Email customization per Org [beta betaBackground]^Beta^
ThoughtSpot embedded users can now customize their automated email notifications for each Org through REST APIs v2. You can customize features such as the company logo, style, and fonts, visibility of components in the template, and ThoughtSpot-specific content in notification emails, thus ensuring a consistent brand experience.

For more information, see xref:customize-email-apis.adoc[Customize email template].

[NOTE]
====
These APIs are currently in beta and turned off by default on ThoughtSpot instances. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====

=== Publishing content to Orgs [beta betaBackground]^Beta^

The publishing feature enables administrators to publish objects from the Primary Org to other Orgs within a multi-tenant instance. This feature simplifies the deployment process for ThoughtSpot administrators, especially when the same object needs to be made available to multiple Orgs within an instance. It also eliminates the need to create duplicate copies of the object, thereby optimizing memory usage.

The publishing feature includes a set of REST APIs that ThoughtSpot administrators can use to create and assign variables, parameterize properties of underlying data objects such as Connections and Tables per Org, and publish objects from the Primary Org to other Orgs on their instance. For more information, see xref:publishing-overview.adoc[Publishing content to Orgs].

[NOTE]
====
The publishing feature is in beta and turned off by default on ThoughtSpot instances. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

Replaced with `SpotterEmbed`
* `ConversationViewConfig` +
Replaced with `SpotterEmbedViewConfig`
* `BodylessConversation` +
Replaced with `SpotterAgentEmbed`
* `BodylessConversationViewConfig` +
Replaced with `SpotterAgentEmbedViewConfig`

[discrete]
==== Impact on Spotter embed deployments
The new Spotter embed components are available for use with the Visual Embed SDK v1.38.0 and later.
The `ConversationEmbed`, `ConversationViewConfig`, `BodylessConversation`, and `BodylessConversationViewConfig` components are deprecated in Visual Embed SDK v1.38.0 and later versions.
The old component names will be visible in the code panel of the Visual Embed Playground on ThoughtSpot instances with 10.9.0.cl or earlier. The component names in the Playground will be updated in an  upcoming version.

[discrete]
==== Recommended action
The Spotter embed component changes do not break your existing Spotter embed implementation. Your  implementation with the old component names will continue to function until further notice. However, ThoughtSpot recommends transitioning to the new names as early as you can, to allow sufficient time for testing your implementation with the updated names.

For Spotter embed documentation and code samples with new components, see xref:embed-spotter.adoc[Embed Spotter].
====
.Ability to control the visibility of columns in full app embedding
[%collapsible]
====
You can now show or hide the following columns on the *Liveboards*, and *Answers* list pages in full application embeds:

* `Favorite`
* `Author`
* `Last modified`

.REST API Java SDK
[%collapsible]
====
The REST API Java SDK enables developers to interact programmatically with ThoughtSpot REST APIs from Java applications. It provides a client library with Java methods and classes that map to API endpoints, handle authentication, send API requests, and allow creating and modifying ThoughtSpot resources and objects.

For information about how to install and use the SDK, see xref:rest-api-java-sdk.adoc[Java SDK for REST APIs].
====

== Version 10.8.0.cl

.React Native SDK to embed ThoughtSpot in a mobile app [beta betaBackground]^Beta^
[%collapsible]
====
Developers can now embed ThoughtSpot Analytics in their mobile apps using the React Native Embed SDK [beta betaBackground]^Beta^. With the React Native Embed SDK, developers can use native resources and a single codebase to build their mobile app with embedded ThoughtSpot content for both *iOS* and *Android* platforms.

In the initial release, the SDK supports embedding a Liveboard component and customizing the embedded view. For more information, see xref:mobilesdk-quick-start.adoc[React Native SDK quick start guide].
====
.External tools and custom script integration
[%collapsible]
====
You can now integrate third-party tools and execute custom scripts within your embed. This feature is disabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances. When enabled, you can use this feature to integrate your preferred analytics and product-guide tools such as Pendo, LogRocket, and Mixpanel into your ThoughtSpot embed.

While you can inject custom Javascript into your embeds, it is essential to consider the associated security risks and vulnerabilities, such as Cross-site scripting (XSS). Before contacting Support to enable this feature on your instance, assess the potential security risks to your application environment and review your organization's security guidelines. We recommend that you sanitize user data before rendering and ensure that your environment runs scripts from trusted domains only. For more information, see xref:3rd-party-script.adoc[Integrate third-party tools and scripts].
====
.Recommended action for deployments that use pendoTrackingKey
[%collapsible]
====
If you are using the xref:EmbedConfig.adoc#_pendotrackingkey[pendoTrackingKey] setting in the Visual Embed SDK, note that ThoughtSpot will deprecate this attribute six months after the 10.8.0.cl release. While you can continue using `pendoTrackingKey` until its deprecation, we recommend using the xref:3rd-party-script.adoc[external tools integration] feature to integrate your preferred tool for analytics and product guides. For additional information or migration assistance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====
.Help menu and information center changes
[%collapsible]
====
In the 10.8.0.cl release, ThoughtSpot introduces a unified help and support experience that will eventually replace the information center panel generated by Pendo.
The new information panel provides access to ThoughtSpot documentation and support and also allows you to add custom links. This feature will be enabled gradually on ThoughtSpot instances.

This change will affect your instance if you have embedded the full ThoughtSpot experience with the top navigation bar and Help (?) icon, using `showPrimaryNavbar: true` and `disableProfileAndHelp: false` settings in the Visual Embed SDK.

Customer environments currently using the legacy information center during embedded sessions will continue to do so for the next few months to minimize disruption. Your ThoughtSpot Customer Success team will contact you and assist you in migrating to the new experience.

To facilitate testing and the rollout of the new information center, ThoughtSpot provides the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_enablependohelp[enablePendoHelp] SDK flag. By default, the `enablePendoHelp` is set to `true` to ensure that your embedded sessions use the legacy information center generated by Pendo. To enable the new experience, you need to set `enablePendoHelp` to `false`.
====
.Column name localization [beta betaBackground]^Beta^
[%collapsible]
====
ThoughtSpot now supports column name and description aliases in a Worksheet or Model, which can be used for localizing the Search and Answer interfaces. This feature is disabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances. To enable this feature, contact ThoughtSpot support.

Additionally, you can view and download the default CSS variables in JSON format and upload a JSON file containing custom values for these CSS variables.

For more information, see xref:theme-builder.adoc[Theme Builder].
====
.Multi-Factor authentication and REST API behavior
[%collapsible]
====
ThoughtSpot now supports Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ for environments using local authentication with IAMv2. MFA is in beta and disabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances. When enabled on a ThoughtSpot instance, administrators can enable MFA for all local users authenticating to ThoughtSpot with `username` and `password`.

[tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE#

When MFA is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, using basic authentication in REST API calls to the following API endpoints will result in an error:

* `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login`
* `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object`
* `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full`
* `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`
* `POST /tspublic/v1/session/login`

When MFA is enabled on a ThoughtSpot instance, local authentication users cannot log in with their `username` and `password` and are prompted to enable MFA when they try to log in via UI. Setting up MFA via APIs is not supported.

If you are using REST APIs with basic authentication, ThoughtSpot recommends updating your application environment to use `username` and `secret_key` to generate authentication token. To stay security compliant and avoid breaking changes, before activating MFA for your users, we recommend that you enable *Trusted Authentication* on your instance and set up your embed and REST API environments to use token-based authentication. For more information and assistance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====
.Liveboard enhancements
[%collapsible]
====
[discrete]
==== Compact Liveboard header [earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#

Developers embedding ThoughtSpot Liveboards can now enable the Compact Liveboard feature for their application users. When enabled, this feature optimizes Liveboard header space, moves the tabs panel to the top of the header, and maximizes the visibility of the charts and tables on the Liveboard.

Compact Liveboard header is disabled by default. To enable this feature, set `isLiveboardCompactHeaderEnabled` to `true` in the SDK.

[discrete]
==== Show only relevant filters and Parameters on Liveboards

By default, Liveboards display all filters and parameters, including those that are not applicable to the visualizations in a tab. On embedded Liveboards, developers can control the visibility of filters and Parameters for visualizations in a tab using the `hideirrelevantchipsinliveboardtabs` property in the SDK.

For more information about filters for Liveboard tabs, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-filters#_apply_filters_to_specific_visualizations_or_tabs[Apply filters to specific visualizations or tabs].
====
.Worksheet to Model conversion
[%collapsible]
====
You can now convert a Worksheet to a Model via a REST API POST call to the
+++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fmetadata%2Fconvert-worksheet-to-model">/api/rest/2.0/metadata/worksheets/convert</a>+++ endpoint.

ThoughtSpot recommends migrating your Worksheet data to Models, because Worksheets are deprecated in ThoughtSpot and will be removed from the product in 10.10.0.cl release.
====
.ThoughtSpot Enterprise Org enablement
[%collapsible]
====
Starting with ThoughtSpot Cloud 10.6.0.cl release, all ThoughtSpot Enterprise instances will gradually be enabled with Orgs.  Your environment will remain a single-tenant instance until you create Orgs. When the Orgs feature is enabled on your instance, you can switch to a single-tenant mode anytime by deleting all user-created Orgs and using only the default Primary Org.

== Version 10.5.0.cl

.Default search experience on embedded ThoughtSpot Home page
[%collapsible]
====
If your ThoughtSpot instance is upgraded from 10.1.0.cl to 10.5.0.cl, the Natural Language Search interface will be the default search experience on the embedded ThoughtSpot Home page. The split search experience, which was introduced in 10.3.0.cl, will be turned off by default on these instances. For applications embedding full ThoughtSpot experience, the `isUnifiedSearchExperienceEnabled` property will be set to `true` in the Visual Embed SDK. Your application users can continue to use the unified experience until it is deprecated. However, developers can choose to disable the unified search experience and customize the Home page search experience for their application users.

On instances upgraded from 10.3.0.cl or 10.4.0.cl to 10.5.0.cl, Object Search will be the default search experience on the embedded ThoughtSpot Home page. The unified search experience will be disabled by default and the `isUnifiedSearchExperienceEnabled` property in the Visual Embed SDK will be set to `false`. If required, developers can switch to AI Search experience by setting the `homePageSearchBarMode` property to `aiAnswer`.

For more information, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_search_experience_on_home_page[Home page search experience customization].
====
.Support for partitioned cookies
[%collapsible]
====
With most web browsers blocking third-party cookies, cookies will no longer be shared across the ThoughtSpot
embedded pages and the host application, or other tabs in the browser. If your embed no longer functions without the use of third-party cookies, consider using one of the following options:

* Update your implementation to use cookieless authentication; for example, `AuthType.EmbeddedSSO` or `AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless` (Recommended)
* Customize the domain of your ThoughtSpot instance to match the domain of your host application. +
For more information, see xref:custom-domain-configuration.adoc[Custom domain configuration].
* Enable partitioned cookies on your ThoughtSpot instance. +
If your implementation relies on cookies or if you are using `AuthType.None` in your development and test environments, ThoughtSpot administrators have the option to enable partitioned cookies on their instance. With partitioned cookies, you can restrict cookie sharing between different sites and thus prevent cross-site tracking.
+
On browsers that support partitioned cookies, the session cookie will persist in the ThoughtSpot app after a successful login. When using the `AuthType.None` embed authentication method in development or test environments with partitioned cookies, users must log in to their ThoughtSpot instance using basic authentication for seamless access to the embed.
+
[NOTE]
Safari blocks all third-party cookies and does not support partitioned cookies. ThoughtSpot recommends switching to a Web browser that supports partitioned cookies or using cookieless authentication.

For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc#_enable_partitioned_cookies[Security Settings].
====

.ABAC via tokens implementation changes
[%collapsible]
====
The ABAC via tokens feature is GA in 10.5.0.cl. Several changes have been introduced since the ThoughtSpot 10.4.0.cl release to improve the ABAC configuration workflows:

* The `user_parameters` property in `auth/token/full` and `auth/token/object` APIs used for the xref:abac-user-parameters-beta.adoc[beta implementation of ABAC] was deprecated in 10.4.0.cl.
* Starting from 10.4.0.cl, administrators are advised to xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc[use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint] to define security attributes for ABAC implementation.

If you have implemented ABAC using `auth/token/full` or `auth/token/object` API endpoints and your cluster is upgraded to 10.4.0.cl or 10.5.0.cl, you can migrate your implementation to start using the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint. For more information, refer to xref:jwt-migration.adoc[ABAC migration guide].
====
.Orgs context for custom links
[%collapsible]

GUID mapping::

If a TML file on your source environment contains GUIDs that don't match the GUIDs on your destination environment, the version control APIs can now automatically handle the mapping of GUIDs when deploying the TML content.

+
For more information, see xref:version_control.adoc#_guid_mapping[Git integration and version control].

Folder structure changes [tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE#::

The folder structure of the TML objects in the Git repository is modified in 9.4.0.cl. In earlier releases, the TML objects were stored in the object directory of the `primary` root folder, for example `primary/liveboard`. Starting from 9.4.0.cl, the TML objects will be stored in the object folder at the root level. ThoughtSpot will not migrate your existing TML files from `primary/<object-dir>` to the new folder structure. You must move these files to the respective object directory at the root level.

File naming convention [tag redBackground]#BREAKING CHANGE#::
Starting from 9.4.0.cl, the TML files pushed to a Git branch from a ThoughtSpot instance are named in the
`<object-name>.<guid>.tml` format. The earlier releases used the `<guid>.<object-name>.tml` naming convention for TML files. This change may break your current setup. We recommend that you reconfigure the Git connection on your ThoughtSpot instance and start using the version control feature from scratch.

====
.Runtime Parameter overrides
[%collapsible]
====
Embedded application users can now create Worksheet and Answer Parameters to optimize data queries. You can also adjust values and apply overrides at runtime on a Liveboard or Answer either via REST API or by appending Parameters to the query URL in the UI.

For more information, see xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[Runtime Parameter overrides].
====
.Link customization
[%collapsible]

====
.Cross filters on Liveboard visualizations [earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#
[%collapsible]
====
ThoughtSpot now supports brushing and linking of visualizations on a Liveboard using cross filters. Cross filters allow you to present a coordinated view of a Liveboard by applying filters across all visualizations based on the current selection.

[NOTE]
The Cross filters feature is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your instance, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.

To hide or disable the cross filter feature on an embedded instance, use the `Action.CrossFilter` and `Action.RemoveCrossFilter` parameters in the SDK. For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Show or hide menu items] and xref:Action.adoc[Action reference].
[discrete]
=== Contextual menu behavior

By default, the contextual menu in ThoughtSpot application pages is set as right-click pop-up menu. Starting from 9.2.0.cl, you can set the contextual menu to trigger on left-click.

To trigger the contextual menu on left-click or right-click on an embedded app, you can use the `contextMenuTrigger` property in the Visual Embed SDK. In the following example, the contextual menu is configured to trigger on left-click.

----
contextMenuTrigger: "left-click"
----

----
contextMenuTrigger: ContextMenuTriggerOptions.LEFT_CLICK
----

When set as right-click menu (default behavior)::
The contextual menu opens on right-click. If you want to monitor right-click actions and listen to the right-click events on a chart or table, use `EmbedEvent.VizPointRightClick` event. For more information, see link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent#_vizpointrightclick[VizPointRightClick].

When set as left-click menu::
The contextual menu opens on left-click. If your app is already using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to listen to left-click events on a visualization, the `VizPointClick` event will be triggered whenever a user clicks on an action in the contextual menu. If you are using `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` to trigger actions such as updating runtime filters on a Liveboard visualization, the click events from left-click contextual menu may impact your app’s current workflow.

+
We recommend using a development environment to test your customizations before rolling them out on production servers. For more information, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

==== New Liveboard experience rollout on embedded instances

The new Liveboard experience is currently available in BETA on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. The new liveboard experience will be rolled out on embedded instances in phases:

In ThoughtSpot Cloud 8.6.0.cl::

The new Liveboard experience is turned off by default on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. If you are using the Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot, you can xref:embed-pinboard.adoc#lbv2[set the `liveboardV2` parameter] in the SDK package to `true` and enable the new experience globally for all users on your instance. +

+
ThoughtSpot users with administrator privileges can also link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-experience-new[turn on the new Liveboard experience, window=_blank] at the cluster level.

In later releases::
The new Liveboard Experience will be turned on by default for all embed application users. To switch to the classic experience, you can set the `liveboardV2` parameter to `false` in the SDK, or change the Liveboard experience preference in the `Admin` tab of the ThoughtSpot UI.

[NOTE]
The Liveboard experience setting in the SDK takes precedence over the cluster-level settings in the *Admin* tab.

[discrete]
==== Actions and Events in the SDK
If you have enabled the new Liveboard experience on your instance, you can use the `Action` and `Event` enumeration members available in the SDK package to customize an embedded object and improve interactivity.

For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum. Similarly, you can trigger events such as  `VizPointClick`  on visualizations in an embedded Liveboard.

Effective from the ThoughtSpot 8 November Cloud release, ThoughtSpot pinboards are rebranded as Liveboards and optimized for live analytics in cloud deployments. Along with granular insights, Liveboards offer interactive data analytics experience with enhanced capabilities.

As part of rebranding, we have made some terminology changes in the ThoughtSpot UI and Developer portal. We are in the process of rolling out terminology changes across all ThoughtSpot interfaces, platforms, and information artifacts. During this period, your environment may show some instances of `pinboard` based on the rebranding rollout stage. In some cases, we may even continue to use the legacy terminology for backward compatibility, and to ensure that your existing integrations work seamlessly.

Starting from ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud October release, you _do not_ require a separate license to create or manage custom actions. The *Custom action* feature is unlocked on all clusters that have a valid ThoughtSpot Enterprise Cloud service subscription. ThoughtSpot Cloud service users with Developer or Admin privileges can access the *Custom actions* feature in the *Develop* tab.

|[tag redBackground]#REMOVED# a|+++<h5>The Only allow in context menu checkbox</<h5> +++

The *Only allow in context menu* checkbox in the custom action creation dialog is removed from the UI. This checkbox was available in previous releases to allow developers to set a custom action to appear only in the contextual menu on pinboard visualizations, charts, or tables.

If you have created custom actions with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled on your instance, note these custom action workflow changes:

* If you have a *Global* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled, the configuration setting _is not_ preserved and the action is placed in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu instead of the contextual menu.
+
You can xref:custom-actions-edit.adoc[modify the position of this action] by using the *Edit* option in the *Custom actions* panel on a visualization or search results page.

* If you have a *Local* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled and the action is already assigned to a Worksheet, visualization, chart, or table, the configuration setting _is_ preserved and the custom action shows up in the contextual menu.

* If you have a *Local* custom action with the *Only allow in context menu* setting enabled, but it is not assigned to a Worksheet, visualization, chart, or table, the action will not be available as a menu item or button. You must add the action to a visualization, chart, or table, and configure its position as required.

.Custom actions
[%collapsible]

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Global and local custom actions</h5>+++

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports configuring a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations, or a specific custom action that can be added to a visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. The custom actions panel in the visualization page allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>Authentication schemes for custom actions</h5>+++

You can now apply an authentication scheme for a custom action that triggers a data payload to a specific URL target. If an action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.
ThoughtSpot will use this information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|
+++<h5>Custom action position settings</h5>+++

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

.Custom link format for embedded instances
[%collapsible]

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>SAML authentication</h5>+++

The Visual Embed SDK packages now include the `noRedirect` attribute as an optional parameter for  the `SSO` `AuthType`. If you want to display the SAML authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see the instructions for embedding xref:full-embed.adoc[ThoughtSpot pages], xref:embed-search.adoc[search], xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[pinboard], and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE#  a|+++<h5>Visual Embed SDK notification when third-party cookies are disabled</h5>+++

When a user accesses the embedded application from a web browser that has third-party cookies disabled, the Visual Embed SDK emits the `NoCookieAccess` event to notify the developer. Cookies are disabled by default in Safari. Users can enable third-party cookies in Safari’s Preferences setting page or use another web browser.
To know how to enable this setting by default on Safari for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
