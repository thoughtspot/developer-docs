== Version 9.10.0.cl

|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|Deployment via version control API fails after the destination Org is renamed.
a|**Symptom**: Deploying TML from the  `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` API endpoint fails when the destination Org is renamed and results in new files being created in the GitHub repository. +
**Condition**: This issue occurs because ThoughtSpot creates mapping files to match GUIDs of source and destination environments. These mapping files use the name of the organization to look up the GUIDs that need to be set on the TML deployed in the destination Org. +
**Workaround**: To work around this issue: +

. Log in to the GitHub account integrated with your ThoughtSpot instance.
. Navigate to the GitHub repository that stores ThoughtSpot files.
. Select the branch that stores configuration files. +

. Navigate to the folder ending with `[...].mapping`.
+

image::./images/cicd-mapping-json.png[CICD Git branch]

. Check the `.json` file with the old name of your Org. If it exists, delete it: these are the new mappings created after the latest deployment. +
+
[NOTE]
====
You may have to delete the matching files in ThoughtSpot that have been created as part of this deployment operation.
====
. Locate the `.json` file with the old name of your Org and rename the file with the new name of the Org.
`<my_old_org_name>.json` -> `<my_new_org_name>.json`

After you complete these steps, the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` endpoint will use this mapping file and deploy to the destination Org successfully.

a|The download menu actions are not visible in the embedded view|

**Symptom**: Although the `Action.Download` enumeration is defined in the `visibleActions` array, the **Download** menu options are hidden in the embedded view. +
**Condition**: This issue occurs on ThoughtSpot instances with 9.10.0.cl or earlier versions. +
**Workaround**: If you are using the `visibleActions` array to show or hide actions on a visualization or Answer, include the following download action enumerations along with `Action.Download` in the array: +

* `Action.DownloadAsCsv` +
* `Action.DownloadAsPdf` +
* `Action.DownloadAsXlsx` +
* `Action.DownloadAsPng`

|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|The **View Liveboard** link in Liveboard schedule notifications do not show the custom URL| Currently, ThoughtSpot doesn't support customizing the **View Liveboard**  URL for Liveboard schedule notifications.
|When you try to update the list of CORS hosts on the **Security Settings** page, you may notice a domain validation error if a subdomain with a wildcard, for example `.*.domain.com`, is already added to the CORS allowed list on your ThoughtSpot instance.
a|To resolve this issue, add an escape character (`\`) after the wildcard in the domain URL string as shown here:

`.*\.domain.com`

|SCAL-142933|The REST API v2.0 session login endpoint does not return session cookies. a|*Symptom*: The `/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login` endpoint does not return session cookies after a successful API call. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed when a REST client tries to log in to ThoughtSpot with basic authentication using the REST API v2.0 `session/login` endpoint. +

*Workaround*: Use one of the following options: +

* Use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API endpoint xref:authentication.adoc#bearerToken[to get a bearer token] and use it in the `Authorization` header to authorize your subsequent API requests.
* Use the REST API v1 endpoint `/tspublic/v1/session/login` to log in to ThoughtSpot and obtain session cookies.

|SCAL-117106| The User account gets locked after a single bad token login attempt a|
*Symptom*: If a user attempts to log in to the embedded ThoughtSpot app with an invalid token, the application locks that user's account. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with the trusted authentication setup. +

*Workaround*: If you are using the trusted authentication method to authenticate your users, make sure the `getAuthToken` function in the SDK returns a fresh token for each re-login. Avoid using older tokens to renew a user session.
