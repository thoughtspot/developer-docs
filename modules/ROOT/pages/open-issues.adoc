This page lists the known issues that you might run into while embedding ThoughtSpot in your app, or when using the embedded interface or making REST API calls.


== Version 9.5.0.sw

[cols="2,4]
[options='header']
|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|When you try to update the list of CORS hosts on the **Security Settings** page, you may notice a domain validation error if a subdomain with a wildcard, for example `.*.domain.com`, is already added to the CORS allowed list on your ThoughtSpot instance.
a|To resolve this issue, add an escape character (`\`) after the wildcard in the domain URL string as shown here:

`.*\.domain.com`

|Issue ID |Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|SCAL-142933|The REST API v2.0 session login endpoint does not return session cookies. a|*Symptom*: The `/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login` endpoint does not return session cookies after a successful API call. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed when a REST client tries to log in to ThoughtSpot with basic authentication using the REST API v2.0 `session/login` endpoint. +

*Workaround*: Use one of the following options: +

* Use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API endpoint xref:authentication.adoc#bearerToken[to get a bearer token] and use it in the `Authorization` header to authorize your subsequent API requests.
* Use the REST API v1 endpoint `/tspublic/v1/session/login` to log in to ThoughtSpot and obtain session cookies.
|SCAL-117106| The User account gets locked after a single bad token login attempt a|
*Symptom*: If a user attempts to log in to the embedded ThoughtSpot app with an invalid token, the application locks that user's account. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with the trusted authentication setup. +

*Workaround*: If you are using the trusted authentication method to authenticate your users, make sure the `getAuthToken` function in the SDK returns a fresh token for each re-login. Avoid using older tokens to renew a user session.

|SCAL-126662 a| The visualizations with no data take a long time to load in an embedded Liveboard. |
*Symptom*:  In the Liveboard classic experience mode, when chart visualizations have no data, they clog the render queue and slow down the Liveboard rendering process. The PDF download function also does not work on such Liveboards.  +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with 8.4.0.cl or 8.4.1.sw or later release versions. +

*Workaround*: None

a| The REST API v2 Playground [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ does not load request parameters for some API endpoints. a|

*Symptom*: Some REST v2 API [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints may not show request parameters in the Playground. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with 8.8.1.sw release version. +

*Workaround*: Use REST API v1 endpoints for production use cases.
