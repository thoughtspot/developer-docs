This page lists the known issues that you might run into while embedding ThoughtSpot in your app, or when using the embedded interface or making REST API calls.

== Version 10.5.0.cl

[cols="4,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|When a visualization in Liveboard embed is opened in edit mode, empty spaces appear beneath or above the visualization area.|
**Symptom**: +
When `fullHeight` is set to true in a Liveboard embed, visualizations show empty areas in the edit mode.

**Conditions**: +
The `fullHeight` property dynamically sets the height of the embed container according to the height of the Liveboard. When a visualization is opened in edit mode, the same dynamic height is applied, which can result in empty space appearing on the visualization pages. This is a known limitation.

**Workaround**: +
None. This is a display issue and does not affect the underlying data or functionality.

|When names are used as identifiers in path parameters, the API requests return `400 - Bad request` error.
|
**Symptom**: +
If the identifier is a required attribute in the path parameter and contains a forward slash `/`, for example `N/firstname/lastname` as `user_identifier`, the APIâ€™s URI structure changes and results in a `400 - Bad Request` error. This effectively alters the API contract, making it invalid.

**Conditions**: +
This is a known limitation, which affects API requests to `/api/rest/2.0/users/{user_identifier}/delete`, `/api/rest/2.0/users/{user_identifier}/update` or any endpoint that accepts identifier as the path parameter.

**Workaround**: +
To avoid this issue, use GUID instead of the name for object, user, Role, and group identifiers in path parameters.

|The `logLevel` property does not suppress ThoughtSpot application logs.|
**Symptom**: +
The `logLevel` attribute in the Visual Embed SDK does not suppress ThoughtSpot application logs. For example, despite setting `logLevel:LogLevel.Error` or `logLevel:LogLevel.Silent`, the application logs for alerts, warnings, and debug messages are shown in the console output.

**Conditions**: +
This issue is observed on ThoughtSpot instances running 10.5.0.cl and earlier versions.

**Workaround**: +
None.

== Version 9.12.5.cl

[cols="2,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|The full view of the Liveboard is not visible when users switch between tabs|
**Symptom**: +
When users switch between tabs on an embedded Liveboard, the height of the Liveboard page changes and cuts the Liveboard content.

**Conditions**: +
This issue was observed on ThoughtSpot embedded instancess using Visual Embed SDK versions below v1.29.0, with the `fullHeight` property set to `true`.

**Workaround**: +
To resolve this issue, upgrade to Visual Embed SDK v1.29.0 or later.

== Version 9.12.0.cl

[cols="2,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
| Exporting and reimporting TML in YAML format returns an error.
a|**Symptom**: +
On exporting and reimporting TML in YAML format in the REST API v2 Playground, the following error message is returned:
`Invalid YAML/JSON syntax in file.`

**Conditions**: +
This issue occurs because when reimporting TML invalid characters are added to the TML YAML content in the Playground resulting in an invalid syntax error.

**Workaround**: +
See xref:tml.adoc#yamlReimport[YAML reimport in the REST API v2 Playground].

== Version 9.10.0.cl

[cols="2,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|Deployment via version control API fails after the destination Org is renamed.
a|**Symptom**: Deploying TML from the  `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` API endpoint fails when the destination Org is renamed and results in new files being created in the GitHub repository. +
**Condition**: This issue occurs because ThoughtSpot creates mapping files to match GUIDs of source and destination environments. These mapping files use the name of the organization to look up the GUIDs that need to be set on the TML deployed in the destination Org. +
**Workaround**: To work around this issue: +

. Log in to the GitHub account integrated with your ThoughtSpot instance.
. Navigate to the GitHub repository that stores ThoughtSpot files.
. Select the branch that stores configuration files. +
+
[.bordered]
image::./images/ts-ci-cd-branch.png[CI/CD Git branch]

. Navigate to the folder ending with `[...].mapping`.
+
[.bordered]
image::./images/cicd-mapping-json.png[CICD Git branch]

. Check the `.json` file with the old name of your Org. If it exists, delete it: these are the new mappings created after the latest deployment. +
+
[NOTE]
====
You may have to delete the matching files in ThoughtSpot that have been created as part of this deployment operation.
====
. Locate the `.json` file with the old name of your Org and rename the file with the new name of the Org.
`<my_old_org_name>.json` -> `<my_new_org_name>.json`

After you complete these steps, the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` endpoint will use this mapping file and deploy to the destination Org successfully.

a|The download menu actions are not visible in the embedded view|

**Symptom**: Although the `Action.Download` enumeration is defined in the `visibleActions` array, the **Download** menu options are hidden in the embedded view. +
**Condition**: This issue occurs on ThoughtSpot instances with 9.10.0.cl or earlier versions. +
**Workaround**: If you are using the `visibleActions` array to show or hide actions on a visualization or Answer, include the following download action enumerations along with `Action.Download` in the array: +

* `Action.DownloadAsCsv` +
* `Action.DownloadAsPdf` +
* `Action.DownloadAsXlsx` +
* `Action.DownloadAsPng`

|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|The **View Liveboard** link in Liveboard schedule notifications do not show the custom URL| Currently, ThoughtSpot doesn't support customizing the **View Liveboard**  URL for Liveboard schedule notifications.
|When you try to update the list of CORS hosts on the **Security Settings** page, you may notice a domain validation error if a subdomain with a wildcard, for example `.*.domain.com`, is already added to the CORS allowed list on your ThoughtSpot instance.
a|To resolve this issue, add an escape character (`\`) after the wildcard in the domain URL string as shown here:

`.*\.domain.com`

|SCAL-142933|The REST API v2.0 session login endpoint does not return session cookies. a|*Symptom*: The `/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login` endpoint does not return session cookies after a successful API call. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed when a REST client tries to log in to ThoughtSpot with basic authentication using the REST API v2.0 `session/login` endpoint. +

*Workaround*: Use one of the following options: +

* Use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API endpoint xref:authentication.adoc#bearerToken[to get a bearer token] and use it in the `Authorization` header to authorize your subsequent API requests.
* Use the REST API v1 endpoint `/tspublic/v1/session/login` to log in to ThoughtSpot and obtain session cookies.

|SCAL-117106| The User account gets locked after a single bad token login attempt a|
*Symptom*: If a user attempts to log in to the embedded ThoughtSpot app with an invalid token, the application locks that user's account. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with the trusted authentication setup. +

*Workaround*: If you are using the trusted authentication method to authenticate your users, make sure the `getAuthToken` function in the SDK returns a fresh token for each re-login. Avoid using older tokens to renew a user session.
