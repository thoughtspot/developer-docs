== Version 10.1.0.sw

[cols="2,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|The full view of the Liveboard is not visible when users switch between tabs|
**Symptom**: +
When users switch between tabs on an embedded Liveboard, the height of the Liveboard page changes and cuts the Liveboard content.

**Conditions** +
This issue was observed on ThoughtSpot embedded instances using Visual Embed SDK versions below v1.29.0, with the `fullHeight` property set to `true`.

**Workaround** +
To resolve this issue, upgrade to Visual Embed SDK v1.29.0 or later.

| Exporting and reimporting TML in YAML format returns an error.
a|**Symptom**: +
On exporting and reimporting TML in YAML format in the REST API v2 Playground, the following error message is returned:
`Invalid YAML/JSON syntax in file.`
**Conditions**: +
This issue occurs because when reimporting TML invalid characters are added to the TML YAML content in the Playground resulting in an invalid syntax error.
**Workaround**:
We recommend the following steps to work around this issue: +

. On the REST API v2 Playground, +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fmetadata%2Fexport-metadata-tml">export the TML in YAML format</a>+++.
. Copy the edoc output from the API response in the code panel.
. Paste it in a text editor such as Sublime. +
For example, `"guid: a162289a-c1ab-427e-9985-8fb5f7c7e539\nliveboard:\n  name: Liveboard 1\n"`
+
. Check if the output is enclosed in quotation marks ("). Remove the quotation marks and update the TML text as shown here: +
`guid: a162289a-c1ab-427e-9985-8fb5f7c7e539\nliveboard:\n  name: Liveboard 1\n`

. On the+++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fmetadata%2Fimport-metadata-tml"> Import Metadata TML API page</a>+++, go to **body** > **metadata_tmls** parameter. +
. Add / remove objects in that list based on how many TML objects you want to import.
. Click **VIEW JSON** to view the object properties in JSON format. +
The request body JSON appears as shown in this example:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "metadata_tmls": [
    "metadata_tmls3"
  ],
  "import_policy": "PARTIAL",
  "create_new": false,
  "all_orgs_context": false
}
----
. Replace `metadata_tmls3` with the text copied from step 4. Ensure that the text you copy doesn't include additional characters and quotation marks.
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "metadata_tmls": [
    "guid: a162289a-c1ab-427e-9985-8fb5f7c7e539\nliveboard:\n  name: Liveboard 1\n"
  ],
  "import_policy": "PARTIAL",
  "create_new": false,
  "all_orgs_context": false
}
----
. Execute the API call by clicking **Try it Out**. +

|Deployment via version control API fails after the destination Org is renamed.
a|**Symptom**: Deploying TML from the  `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` API endpoint fails when the destination Org is renamed and results in new files being created in the GitHub repository. +
**Condition**: This issue occurs because ThoughtSpot creates mapping files to match GUIDs of source and destination environments. These mapping files use the name of the organization to look up the GUIDs that need to be set on the TML deployed in the destination Org. +
**Workaround**: To work around this issue: +

. Log in to the GitHub account integrated with your ThoughtSpot instance.
. Navigate to the GitHub repository that stores ThoughtSpot files.
. Select the branch that stores configuration files. +
+
[.bordered]
image::./images/ts-ci-cd-branch.png[CI/CD Git branch]

. Navigate to the folder ending with `[...].mapping`.
+
[.bordered]
image::./images/cicd-mapping-json.png[CICD Git branch]

. Check the `.json` file with the old name of your Org. If it exists, delete it: these are the new mappings created after the latest deployment. +
+
[NOTE]
====
You may have to delete the matching files in ThoughtSpot that have been created as part of this deployment operation.
====
. Locate the `.json` file with the old name of your Org and rename the file with the new name of the Org.
`<my_old_org_name>.json` -> `<my_new_org_name>.json`

After you complete these steps, the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` endpoint will use this mapping file and deploy to the destination Org successfully.

a|The download menu actions are not visible in the embedded view|

**Symptom**: Although the `Action.Download` enumeration is defined in the `visibleActions` array, the **Download** menu options are hidden in the embedded view. +
**Condition**: This issue occurs on ThoughtSpot instances with 9.10.0.cl or earlier versions. +
**Workaround**: If you are using the `visibleActions` array to show or hide actions on a visualization or Answer, include the following download action enumerations along with `Action.Download` in the array: +

* `Action.DownloadAsCsv` +
* `Action.DownloadAsPdf` +
* `Action.DownloadAsXlsx` +
* `Action.DownloadAsPng`

|Issue Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|The **View Liveboard** link in Liveboard schedule notifications do not show the custom URL| Currently, ThoughtSpot doesn't support customizing the **View Liveboard**  URL for Liveboard schedule notifications.
|When you try to update the list of CORS hosts on the **Security Settings** page, you may notice a domain validation error if a subdomain with a wildcard, for example `.*.domain.com`, is already added to the CORS allowed list on your ThoughtSpot instance.
a|To resolve this issue, add an escape character (`\`) after the wildcard in the domain URL string as shown here:

`.*\.domain.com`

|Issue ID |Description| Symptoms, conditions, and workaround
|SCAL-142933|The REST API v2.0 session login endpoint does not return session cookies. a|*Symptom*: The `/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login` endpoint does not return session cookies after a successful API call. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed when a REST client tries to log in to ThoughtSpot with basic authentication using the REST API v2.0 `session/login` endpoint. +

*Workaround*: Use one of the following options: +

* Use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API endpoint xref:authentication.adoc#bearerToken[to get a bearer token] and use it in the `Authorization` header to authorize your subsequent API requests.
* Use the REST API v1 endpoint `/tspublic/v1/session/login` to log in to ThoughtSpot and obtain session cookies.

*Symptom*: If a user attempts to log in to the embedded ThoughtSpot app with an invalid token, the application locks that user's account. +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with the trusted authentication setup. +

*Workaround*: If you are using the trusted authentication method to authenticate your users, make sure the `getAuthToken` function in the SDK returns a fresh token for each re-login. Avoid using older tokens to renew a user session.

|SCAL-126662 a| The visualizations with no data take a long time to load in an embedded Liveboard. |
*Symptom*:  In the Liveboard classic experience mode, when chart visualizations have no data, they clog the render queue and slow down the Liveboard rendering process. The PDF download function also does not work on such Liveboards.  +

*Condition*: This issue is observed in ThoughtSpot deployments with 8.4.0.cl or 8.4.1.sw or later release versions. +

*Workaround*: None
