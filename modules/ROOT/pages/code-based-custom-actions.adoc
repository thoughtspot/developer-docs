:page-description: You can add custom buttons or menu items in your ThoughtSpot code to the ThoughtSpot UI to let your application users to analyze insights and trigger an action on the data.

Code-based custom actions are custom menu items that you define within the application's code through the Visual Embed SDK.

These custom actions add a new menu item to one of the following UI elements in an Answer, Liveboard, visualization, or in the Spotter interface:

* the primary menu bar (except for Spotter)
* the **More** options menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]
* the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or visualization (except for Liveboard)

=== Global and local actions

Developers or administrators can set a custom action as a global or local action.

Global actions::

By default, a global action appears as a menu action in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]menu on all visualizations.
+
Authorized users can edit the position of a global action on a Liveboard, visualization, saved Answer or the Spotter interface by defining the appropriate value for `position`.

Local actions::

Local actions are defined by defining the specific id for the target object in the `metadataIds`.


=== Code based custom action for Liveboards

The custom action is applied on a specific Liveboard, the `liveboardIds` is passed in the `metadataIds`.

[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name: 'CA1',
        id: 'ca1',
        position: CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
        target: CustomActionTarget.LIVEBOARD
        metadataIds: {
            liveboardIds: ['lb1'],
        },
    },
];

----

The custom action is applied on a specific Liveboard with restricted visibility for a group of users in a particular Org. The `liveboardIds` is passed in the `metadataIds` along with the `groupId` and the `orgId`.

[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name : "CA1",
        id: "ca1",
        position: CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
        target: CustomActionTarget.LIVEBOARD,
        metadataIds: {
            liveboardId: ['lb1'],
        },
        groupId: ['grp1'],
        orgId: ['org1'],
    }
]
----

=== Code based custom action for Visualizations

The custom action is applied on all visualizations on a specific Liveboard, the `liveboardIds` is passed in the `metadataIds`. This custom action will also be visible to all new users who have access to the Liveboard.


[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name: 'CA1',
        id: 'ca1',
        position:CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
	    target: CustomActionTarget.VIZ,
        metadataIds: {
            liveboardIds: ['lb1']
        },
    },
];
----

The custom action is applied on a visualization, the `vizIds` is passed in the `metadataIds`.

[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name: 'CA1',
        id: 'ca1',
        position: CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
	    target: CustomActionTarget.VIZ,
        metadataIds: {
            vizIds: ['viz1']
        },
    },
];
----


When both `liveboardIds` and `vizIds` parameters are provided, the system will perform a union of all visualizations associated with the specified `liveboardIds` and the visualizations explicitly referenced by the provided `vizIds` values.

In this example, Liveboard lb1 contains visualizations viz11 and viz12. Another Liveboard, lb2, contains visualizations viz21 and viz22.

* For Liveboard lb2, a custom action will be displayed on all visualizations, since the liveboardId is present.

* The custom action will also be shown only on the visualization with the id viz11 for Liveboard lb1.

[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name: 'CA1',
        id: 'ca1',
        position: CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
        target: CustomActionTarget.VIZ,
        metadataIds: {
            liveboardIds: ['lb2'],
		    vizIds: ['viz21', 'viz11']
        },
    },
];
----

When either `groupId`, `orgId`, or both are provided, custom actions will be displayed only for the visualization for the members of the specified groupId within the specified orgId.

In this example, Liveboard lb1 contains visualizations viz11 and viz12. Another Liveboard, lb2, contains visualizations viz21 and viz22. For a user who is part of org1 and grp1,

* The custom action will be displayed on all visualizations of Liveboard lb2, since the liveboardId is present.

* The custom action will also be shown for visualization viz11.

[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name: 'CA1',
        id: 'ca1',
        position: CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
	    target: CustomActionTarget.VIZ,
        metadataIds: {
            liveboardIds: ['lb2'],
		    vizIds: ['viz21', 'viz11']
        },
        groupId: ['grp1'],
        orgId: ['org1']
    },
];
----

When the answerId parameter is provided, the system displays custom actions only on the visualization(s) that use the specified underlying answerId.

For example, consider a Liveboard (lb1) with three visualizations: viz1 (based on ans1), viz2 (based on ans2), and viz3 (based on ans3).

* The custom action will be displayed on all visualizations of Liveboard lb2, since the liveboardId is present.

* The custom action will also be shown for viz1 and viz 3, as viz1 is explicitly included by vizId, and viz3 uses the specified answerId (ans3) as its underlying data source.

[source,javascript]
----
const customActions = [
    {
        name: 'CA1',
        id: 'ca1',
        position: 'CustomActionPosition.PRIMARY,
	    target: CustomActionTarget.VIZ,
        metadataIds: {
            liveboardIds: ['lb2'],
		    vizIds: ['viz1'],
            answerIds: ['ans3']
        },
    },
