== SDK library for embedding Spotter
ThoughtSpot provides the following Visual Embed SDK libraries for embedding Spotter capabilities in your app:

* xref:embed-spotter.adoc[`SpotterEmbed`] +
Use this SDK component to xref:embed-spotter.adoc[embed the full Spotter experience] in your app). Based on the Spotter version enabled on your instance and the status of their features, the Spotter experience in the embed mode will vary.

* xref:embed-spotter-agent.adoc[`SpotterAgentEmbed`] +
Also known as `bodyless` embedding, `SpotterAgentEmbed` allows you to integrate Spotter capabilities into your own applications or chatbot, route user questions to ThoughtSpot, and receive structured answers and visualizations. Unlike full Spotter embed, the bodyless embed includes only a search bar that your application users can use for prompts.
