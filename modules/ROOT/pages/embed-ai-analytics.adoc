:page-description: To embed ThoughtSpot Spotter and conversational analytics experience in your app, you can use the `SpotterEmbed` or `SpotterAgentEmbed` SDK library.

ThoughtSpot Spotter provides an interactive AI-powered Search and conversational analytics experience for its application users.

== Overview
Spotter features and user experience are broadly categorized into following modes:

* **Spotter classic**
The early and classic version of Spotter with conversational analytics experience in ThoughtSpot. Users can query data in plain language, ask follow-up questions, and get insights and visualizations from their data.  If your organization requires strict data privacy, is in early stages of AI adoption, or only needs metadata-level insights, enable this mode.
* **Spotter 2**
Also known as *Spotter Agent*, Spotter 2 is designed with agentic capabilities for a more advanced and enhanced analytics experience, such as "why" and narrative analysis. This version of Spotter is context-aware and supports depper analysis. If you want to leverage the full power of agentic analytics, richer insights, and advanced AI-driven features with enterprise-grade governance and security, you can enable this mode.
* **Spotter 3**
Spotter 3 is the latest and most advanced version of Spotter. It is fully data-aware, capable of understanding data models and schema with the ability to automatically discover and select data models, break down complex questions into multiple targeted queries and operate in deep research mode. If you want to use the latest features and advanced AI search, research and analytics capabilities, administrators can enable Spotter 3 and the required features on your instance. +
__Available from 26.2.0.cl and later__

== Spotter experience in embedded mode
ThoughtSpot provides the following two distinct SDK libraries to embed Spotter capabilities in your app:

* xref:embed-spotter.adoc[`SpotterEmbed`] +
Use this SDK component to xref:embed-spotter.adoc[embed the Spotter interface in your app). Depending on the release version and feature activation status on your instance, Spotter experience in the embed mode can be Spotter classic, Spotted Agent or Spotter 3.

* xref:embed-spotter-agent.adoc[`SpotterAgentEmbed`] +
Also known as `bodyless` embedding, this embedding mode allows you to Spotter capabilities into your own applications or chatbot. Unlike the standard Spotter embed, bodyless embed includes only a search bar that your application users can use for prompts. The `SpotterAgentEmbed` component is designed for deeper customization and provides full control over user experience. You can build your own UI or agentic experience, route user questions to ThoughtSpot, and receive structured answers and visualizations.
