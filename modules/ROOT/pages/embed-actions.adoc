:page-description: Show or hide actions in embedded Liveboards, visualizations and ThoughtSpot application

ThoughtSpot visualizations, Liveboards, and saved search answers support several actions and menu commands for various user-initiated operations. These actions appear as primary buttons, or as menu commands in *More* image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] or contextual menu. When you embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard, visualization, or the entire application experience in another app, xref:embed-actions.adoc#standard-actions[these actions] will be available to all users by default. However, your application users may not require all the available menu actions, or you might want to restrict access to certain features. 

With Visual Embed SDK APIs, you can define a set of actions that your application users can access and use. The Visual Embed SDK packages support the following APIs to configure the visibility and availability of actions:

visibleActions::
Allows you to define a list of actions that can be made visible to your application users. If your embedded instance requires only a few actions, you can use the `visibleActions` API to add only those actions to the embedded UI.

disabledActions::
Allows you to define a list of actions that will appear as disabled in the UI. You can also specify a reason for disabling the action. For example, your application user may require a specific privilege to schedule a Liveboard job, so you may want to disable this action and specify a reason, such as `Contact your administrator to enable this feature`.

hiddenActions::
Allows you to hide the actions that you don't want your users to see. If your embedded instance requires most of the actions, and you need to hide a few, you can use this API to hide only those actions.

== Configuration recommendations

* Use `visibleActions` when you want to show only a small subset of actions in the embedded ThoughtSpot UI.  
* The SDK doesn't support configuring both `visibleActions` and `hiddenActions`. Before you define `visibleActions`, make sure there are no hidden actions configured. 
* If you want to show all menu actions to your users and hide only a few, use the `hiddenActions` attribute to hide these actions.
* If you are configuring `visibleActions` in the AppEmbed SDK package, make sure to include all the actions that you want to show on **Liveboards**, **Visualizations**, and the *Saved Answers* page. 
* Use the appropriate action string to show or hide a UI action. For a comprehensive list of UI actions and the action strings in the SDK, see xref:embed-actions.adoc#standard-actions[Supported actions].  

== Define visible actions

The Visual Embed SDK packages support the `visibleActions` attribute, which allows you to define an array of action strings. 
For example, if you set the attribute as:

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: [Action.Save,Action.ShowUnderlyingData,Action.Download,Action.DownloadAsCSV,Action.Pin]
----

Only the actions specified in the `visibleActions` attribute will appear in the embedded UI. The embedded application users can access and use the **Save**, **Show underlying data**, *Download as CSV*, and *Pin* menu actions.

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If the `visibleActions` attribute is set as an empty array, no actions will appear in the embedded UI.

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: [] 
----
 
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If you set both `visibleActions` and `disabledActions` attributes as empty arrays, no actions will be visible in the embedded UI:

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: []
disabledActions: [] 
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If you specify some action strings in both `visibleActions` and `disabledActions` attributes, the specified menu actions will appear in the embedded UI. However, users will not be able to access the actions set as `disabledActions`.

In the following example, the **Download**, **Save**, **Share**, and **Pin** actions are defined as visible actions and therefore will be visible in the embedded UI. However, the *Download* menu action will be disabled. 
[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: [Action.Download,Action.Save,Action.Share,Action.Pin]
disabledActions: [Action.Download]
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++


+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If you specify some action strings in the `visibleActions` attribute and define `hiddenActions` as an empty array, only the actions that are configured to be visible will appear in the embedded UI.

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: [Action.DownloadAsPDF,Action.DownloadAsCSV,Action.Save,Action.ShowUnderlyingData,Action.Pin]
hiddenActions: []
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If the `visibleActions` attribute is set as an empty array and the action strings are specified in the `hiddenActions` attribute, the `visibleActions` definition takes precedence. Therefore, no actions will appear in the embedded UI.

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: []
hiddenActions: [Action.DownloadAsPDF,Action.DownloadAsCSV]
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If both `visibleActions` and `hiddenActions` attributes are defined, the SDK will return a configuration error.

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: [Action.DownloadAsPDF,Action.DownloadAsCSV,Action.Save,Action.ShowUnderlyingData,Action.Pin]
hiddenActions: [Action.DownloadAsPDF,Action.DownloadAsCSV]
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+++<p class="divider"> </p>+++

If both `visibleActions` and `hiddenActions` attributes are defined as an empty array, the `visibleActions` definition takes precedence and no actions will appear in the embedded UI.

[source,Javascript]
----
visibleActions: []
hiddenActions: []
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

== Disable actions

If you want to restrict user access to certain actions in the embedded ThoughtSpot Liveboard, visualization, or search results page, you can disable these actions in the embed config view.

The `disabledActions` attribute in the Visual Embed SDK allows you to specify one or several actions and disable these actions on a Liveboard, Answer, or visualization page.

For example, to disable the *Show underlying data* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], you can specify the `ShowUnderlyingData` action string in the `disabledActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.ShowUnderlyingData]
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

Similarly, to disable multiple actions, you can specify the action strings in the `disabledActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.AddFilter,Action.Present]
----

++++

<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/liveboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

=== Disable a custom action

ThoughtSpot allows you to create custom actions for your embedded instance in the Developer portal. If you want to disable a custom action, you can specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute.

For example, if a custom action is labeled as *Send Email* and its ID is set as *send-email*, specify `send-email` in the `disabledActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: ['send-email']
----

=== Add a tooltip for disabled attributes

To add a tooltip for the disabled attribute, you can specify the message text string in the `disabledActionReason` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActionReason: "Contact your administrator to enable this action"
----


++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/liveboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

== Hide actions

The Visual Embed SDK allows you to hide specific actions that you may not want to show in the embedded UI. From the list of available actions, you can either define a list of visible actions using the `visibleActions` attribute or hide specific actions that your application may not require using the `hiddenActions` attribute. Configuring actions in both `visibleActions` and `hiddenActions` attributes leads to an error in embedded content rendition.

For example, if you want to hide only the **Download** and *Pin* actions for an embedded visualization and show all other actions, specify the attribute as shown here:

[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: [Action.Download,Action.Pin]
----

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/liveboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

=== Hide a custom action

To hide a custom action, specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute.
For example, if a custom action is labeled as *Send Email* and its ID is set as *send-email*, specify `send-email` in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: ['send-email']
----

[#primaryAction]
== Override default primary actions

For Liveboards embedded in your app, the Visual Embed SDK provides the `primaryAction` attribute that allows you to override the default action assigned to the primary button on Liveboard visualizations.

If Spotter is enabled on your instance, the Spotter button appears by default as the primary action on embedded Liveboard charts. If Spotter is not enabled on your instance, the *Explore* button is displayed as the default primary action.

To replace the action assigned to this primary button:

Check if the SDK provides an action ID for the action you want to use as the replacement.
Ensure the action you want to use is not hidden or disabled via the hiddenActions or disabledActions arrays.
Define the new primary action in the SDK configuration:

. Check if the SDK includes an action ID for the action you want to use as the replacement.
. Ensure that the action that you want to use is not hidden or disabled via `disabledActions` or `hiddenActions` arrays.
. Configure the new primary action:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
const embed = new LiveboardEmbed("#your-own-div", {
    liveboardId: "<Your-Liveboard-ID>", // Replace with your Liveboard ID
    primaryAction: Action.Download,
});
----
. Render your embed and verify that the default action is replaced with the action you defined.

[NOTE]
====
* The `primaryAction` parameter does not remove the default action; it replaces the action assigned to the primary button.
* If `primaryAction` is configured, the default action is moved to the More options `(...)`  menu, and the action you configured appears as the primary button on your Liveboard visualizations. On Answers, the new action is added as a secondary button, positioned above the chart or table along with other primary actions
