:page-title: Version control and Git integration
:page-pageid: git-integration
:page-description: The version control APIs and Git integration capability let you connect your ThoughtSpot instance to a Git repository, push changes, and deploy commits to your ThoughtSpot environment.

When embedding or deploying a third-party application in their environments, most organizations use defined practices at various stages of their SDLC process. Developers typically use a version control system and CI-CD pipeline to push their code from development to testing and production environments. Similarly, when deploying ThoughtSpot, you may want to publish your ThoughtSpot content from a development environment to a staging or production cluster.

ThoughtSpot objects such as Worksheets, Liveboards, and Answers are stored as link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML), window=_blank] content. Users can download these TML files, edit these files locally, and import the updated content into ThoughtSpot. TML files are also useful when migrating content from one ThoughtSpot instance to another.

With The Git integration feature, ThoughtSpot provides the ability to connect your deployment instance to a Git repository, push TML files to CI/CD pipelines, and deploy commits from your Git repository to your production environment.

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot currently supports GitHub / GitHub Enterprise for CI/CD.
====

== Git integration overview

The Git integration feature supports the following capabilities:

* ThoughtSpot integration with Git and CI/CD workflows +
Ability to connect your ThoughtSpot instance to a Git repository and deploy commits via REST API.
* Ability to version control ThoughtSpot content +
Ability to build or modify your content locally on a development instance and push commits to a remote Git branch via APIs and version your updates.
* Ability to address different types of deployment scenarios +
The simplest deployment scenario is moving content from a ThoughtSpot development instance to a production instance.
You can also deploy multiple environments on the same ThoughtSpot instance using the xref:orgs.adoc[Orgs] feature. For example, you can create separate Orgs for `Dev`, `Staging`, and `Prod` environments. The content built from the `Dev` Org can be deployed on `Staging` and `Prod` Orgs using REST API v2.0 version control endpoints.

== How it works

The ThoughtSpot content deployment process with version control APIs and Git integration includes the following steps:

1. xref:version_control.adoc#_enable_git_integration[Enable Git integration on ThoughtSpot].
2. xref:version_control.adoc#connectTS[Connect your ThoughtSpot environment to the Git repository]. +
You can connect your ThoughtSpot development and production environments to the `dev` and production branches on your Git repository. The general practice is to use the `main` branch in the Git repository as a production branch to publish content.
3. xref:version_control.adoc#_commit_tml_files_to_git[Push changes to the Git branch mapped to your ThoughtSpot environment]. +
4. xref:version_control.adoc#_merge_updates_from_dev_branch_to_main_in_git[Validate merge before deploying changes to the destination environment].
5. xref:version_control.adoc[Deploy commits to your production environment] and publish your changes.

The following figure illustrates a simple Git integration workflow with ThoughtSpot `Dev` and `Prod` environments.

== Lifecycle management via git APIs

ThoughtSpot recommends the following lifecycle management flow:

* Implement changes in a ThoughtSpot development environment, and then commit these changes in a Git development branch
* Merge the Git development branch into one deployment branch
* Deploy changes from the Git deployment branch into the ThoughtSpot production/staging environment to update your target environment.


=== Recommended configuration and best practices

* Use one repository per ThoughtSpot version control project. Your ThoughtSpot development, staging, and production environments should all be using the same Git repository. This will make it easier to move objects from `dev` to `prod` (via merging branches).
* Use one commit branch per environment. This is where the ThoughtSpot code will get committed. Do not commit content from different ThoughtSpot environments into the same branch. Each environment uses different unique identifiers (GUIDs) to identify files. Using the same branch to store files from multiple ThoughtSpot environments will result in corrupt branches, errors, and merge conflicts when deploying content to a ThoughtSpot production environment.
+
As a best practice, use the xref:version_control.adoc#_commit_files[commit API] to submit TML changes to Git. This ensures that deleted and renamed files are properly synchronized.
* Use a dedicated branch for version history. As described earlier, a given object's unique identifier will be different between its development and production versions. If you wish to implement version history in a production environment, use a dedicated branch for version history. Do not use a branch that is already used to manage or deploy development objects.
* Use a dedicated branch for all Git configuration files. Dedicate some branches such as `dev` and `main` for ThoughtSpot content and store all Git configuration files created by ThoughtSpot in a separate branch. This will make it much easier to compare ThoughtSpot content across branches.
* Validate the changes before merging or deploying, to ensure the TML content in target environments can import changes without conflicts.
+
The following figure illustrates the lifecycle management with git and best practices for commit and deploy workflows:

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot does not recommend committing changes to Git directly and deploying these changes back in a ThoughtSpot development environment.
====

== Get started

Before you begin, check the following prerequisites:

* You have the required privileges (application administration and data management) to connect ThoughtSpot to a Git repository and deploy commits.
* You have a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account and access to a repository. Ensure that your account has one of the following types of access tokens:
** link:https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#personal-access-tokens-classic[Personal access token (Classic), window=_blank] +
Make sure the access token has the `repo` scope that grants full access to public and private repositories, commit and deployment status, repository invitations, and security events. +
** link:https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens[Fine-grained personal access token, window=_blank] +
Make sure the token allows `Read access to metadata` and `Read and Write access to code and commit statuses`.
* The branches in the Git repository are set up as described in xref:version_control.adoc#_recommended_configuration[Recommended configuration].

=== Enable Git integration

To configure Git branches and workflows, the Git integration feature must be enabled on your ThoughtSpot `Dev` and `Prod` environments. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

////
Run the following `tscli` command on their instances.

[source,SSH]
----
tscli git-integration enable
----
////

[#connectTS]
=== Connect your ThoughtSpot environment to the Git repository

To connect your ThoughtSpot instance to a Git repository using REST API, send a `POST` request with the following parameters to the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/create` REST API v2.0 endpoint.

==== Request parameters
[width="100%" cols="2,6"]
[options='header']
|===
|Parameter|Description
|`repository_url`|__String__. The HTTPS URL of the Git repository; for example, `https://github.com/user/repo.git`.
|`username`
|__String__. Username to authenticate to the Git repository.
|`access_token`|__String__. Access token to authenticate to the Git repository.
|`org_identifier`|__String__. ID of the Org. Define this parameter only if the Orgs feature is enabled on your ThoughtSpot cluster and separate Orgs are configured for development and production environments.
|`branch_names`|__Array of strings__. List of Git branches to configure.
|`commit_branch_name` |__String__. Name of the remote branch where objects committed from this Thoughtspot instance will be versioned. ThoughtSpot recommends using `commit_branch_name` instead of the `default_branch_name` property.
|`default_branch_name` +
__Optional__|__String__. Name of the default Git branch to use for all operations on the cluster. ThoughtSpot recommends using `commit_branch_name` instead of `default_branch_name`. If both these parameters are defined, ThoughtSpot will consider only the branch name defined in `commit_branch_name`.
|`enable_guid_mapping`  |__Boolean__. Enables GUID mapping and generates a GUID mapping file. Starting from 9.7.0.cl, this attribute is set to `true` by default.
To know more about GUID mapping, see xref:version_control.adoc#_guid_mapping_and_configuration_files[GUID mapping].
|`configuration_branch_name` a|__String__. Name of the branch that will contain all configuration files related to operations between ThoughtSpot and Git repository. ThoughtSpot recommends using `configuration_branch_name` instead of the `guid_mapping_branch_name` in the API request. If no branch name is specified, the default `ts_config_files` branch is considered. You must ensure that the configuration branch is available in the Git repository connected to ThoughtSpot.
|`guid_mapping_branch_name` +
__Optional__|__String__. The name of the Git branch to which you want to add the GUID mapping file. ThoughtSpot recommends using the `configuration_branch_name` property in the API request.
||
|===

==== Request example

The following example shows the API request format for connecting ThoughtSpot to a GitHub repository.

[source, cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host-Dev}/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/create' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {Bearer_token}  \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "repository_url": "https://github.com/user/repo.git",
  "username": "ts-git-user",
  "access_token": "{ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "org_identifier": "dev"
  "branch_names": [
    "dev",
    "main"
  ],
  "commit_branch_name": "dev",
  "configuration_branch_name": "_ts_config"
}'
----

If the API request is successful, the ThoughtSpot instance will be connected to the Git repository. Make sure you connect all your environments (`Dev`, `Staging`, and `Prod`) to the GitHub repository.

The following example shows the API request parameters to connect a ThoughtSpot `Prod` instance to the Git repo. Note that  GUID mapping is enabled in the API request.

[source, cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host-Prod}/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/create' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {Bearer_token}  \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "repository_url": "https://github.com/user/repo.git",
  "username": "ts-git-user",
  "access_token": "{ACCESS_TOKEN}",
  "enable_guid_mapping": true,
  "org_identifier": "prod"
  "branch_names": [
    "prod"
  ],
  "enable_guid_mapping": true,
  "commit_branch_name": "prod",
  "configuration_branch_name": "_ts_config"
}'
----

==== GUID mapping and configuration files

ThoughtSpot maintains a set of configuration files to facilitate the CI/CD process for developers. Typically, it includes:

* One mapping file per production environment +
This file documents the GUID mapping for ThoughtSpot development objects from the source cluster, and their equivalent objects in the production environment to which commits are deployed.
* One deploy file per production environment +
This file tracks the last `commit_id` of the last successful deploy operation.

===== GUID mapping

The version control API automatically generates a GUID mapping file when deploying commits and saves this file in a Git branch. The mapping file records the GUIDs for each TML object as shown in this example:

[source,JSON]
----
[
   {
      "originalGuid":"7485d3b6-4b4e-41a2-86be-e031d1322cc9",
      "mappedGuid":"3eeec11e-fbf7-40dc-a549-2f465f640778",
      "counter":0
   }
]
----

* `originalGuid` refers to the GUID of the object on the source environment, for example, a `Dev` cluster.
* `mappedGuid` refers to the GUID of the object on the destination environment, for example, `staging` or `prod` cluster.
* `counter` shows the number of times the mapped object was used in deploy operations.

If GUID mapping is enabled, ThoughtSpot uses the GUID mapping file to map the object GUIDs and automatically updates the object references in your TML content.

The following figure illustrates how GUIDs are mapped during deployments:

[.widthAuto]
image::./images/guid-mapping.png[GUID mapping]

==== Related APIs

* To update the repository details or access token, send a `POST` request with Git configuration parameters to the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/update` API endpoint.
* To get repository configuration information, send a `POST` request to `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/search` API endpoint.
* To delete the repository configuration, send a `POST` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/config/delete` endpoint.

For more information about these endpoints, see the API documentation in the +++<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/api/rest/playgroundV2" target="_blank">REST API v2.0 Playground</a>+++.

=== Commit files

ThoughtSpot users with data management (*Can manage data*) privilege can download TML files to their local environment, xref:modify-tml.adoc[edit TML files], and import them into ThoughtSpot via UI or REST API. With Git integration, users can also push commits from a ThoughtSpot instance to a Git branch via `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/branches/commit` API call.

==== Request parameters
[width="100%" cols="2,8"]
[options='header']
|===
|Parameter|Description
|`metadata`|__Array of Strings__. Specify the `type` and GUID of the metadata object.
|`delete_aware` a|__Boolean__. When `delete_aware` is true, upon committing files, a check is run between the files in the Git branch and the objects in the ThoughtSpot environment. If an object exists in the Git branch, but not in the ThoughtSpot instance or Org, the object will be deleted from the Git branch. The `delete_aware` parameter is enabled by default.
[NOTE]
====
The `delete_aware` property requires you to associate one ThoughtSpot environment or Org to one commit branch in Git. Associating multiple ThoughtSpot environments to the same Git commit branch will result in files getting unintentionally deleted across your environments during a commit operation.
====

|`branch_name` +
__Optional__|__String__. Name of the branch in the Git repository to which you want to push the commit. If you do not specify the branch name, the commit will be pushed to the `commit_branch_name` defined for the xref:version_control.adoc#connectTS[Git connection configuration].
|`comment`|__String__. Add a comment to the commit.
||
|===

==== Request example

The following example shows the API request with Liveboard and Worksheet objects to commit to Git.

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/branches/commit' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {Bearer_token}\
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "identifier": "e9d54c69-d2c1-446d-9529-544759427075",
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "cd252e5c-b552-49a8-821d-3eadaa049cca",
      "type": "LOGICAL_TABLE"
    }
  ],
  "delete_aware": true,
  "comment": "Add objects",
  "branch_name": "prod"
}'
----

==== Results

During this operation, a check is performed to compare the objects in the Git branch with the objects in the ThoughtSpot environment.

* If an object exists in the Git branch, but not in the ThoughtSpot instance or Org, the object will be deleted from the Git branch.
* If the object does not exist in the Git branch, it will be added to the Git branch specified in the API request or `commit_branch_name` configured for the Git connection.
* If the object exists on both the Git branch and ThoughtSpot cluster or Org and there are no changes detected in the commit, the API returns a warning message with a list of objects that were not updated as part of the commit.

The following figure illustrates the commit operation with the `delete_aware` property enabled:

image::./images/delete-aware-commit.png[Commit changes]

==== Search commits

ThoughtSpot provides a REST API endpoint to search commits for a given TML object. A `POST` call to the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/search` endpoint with `metadata` identifier and `type` in the request body fetches a list of commits.

==== Revert a commit
To undo the changes committed to a repository, revert to a previous commit and restore an earlier version of an object using the `/v2/vcs/commits/{commit_id}/revert` API endpoint.

===== Request parameters
[width="100%" cols="2,4"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Parameter|Description
|`commit_id`|__String__. ID of the commit to which you want to revert.
|`metadata` +
__Optional__|__Array of Strings__. Specify the `type` and GUID of the metadata object. If a metadata object is not specified, the API request reverts all objects that were modified as part of the specified `commit_id`.
|`branch_name` +
__Optional__|__String__. Name of the branch to which the revert operation must be applied. If you do not specify the branch name, the API will revert the commit to the default branch configured on that ThoughtSpot instance.
|`revert_policy` a|__String__. Action to apply when reverting a commit. The allowed values are: +

* `ALL_OR_NONE`  (Default) +
Reverts all objects. If the revert operation fails for one of the objects provided in the commit, the API returns an error and does not revert any object.

* `PARTIAL` +
Reverts partial objects. This option reverts the subset of ThoughtSpot objects that validate successfully even if the other objects in the commit fail to import.
||
|=====

==== Request example

The following example shows the API request for reverting a commit.

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/afc0fea831558e30d7064ab019f49243b1f09552/revert' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {Bearer_token}\\
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "identifier": "e9d54c69-d2c1-446d-9529-544759427075",
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
  "commit_id": "afc0fea831558e30d7064ab019f49243b1f09552",
  "branch_name": "dev"
}'
----

==== Results

If the API request is successful, the Git branch is reverted to the specified commit ID.

=== Validate merge

To merge updates, create a pull request to push changes from your `dev` branch to `main`. ThoughtSpot doesn't provide REST APIs to merge content from one branch to another. Before accepting the merge request in the Git repository, you can validate the merge on your ThoughtSpot instance using REST API.

To validate the content of your `dev` branch against your `prod` environment, send a `POST` request from your `prod` instance to the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/branches/validate` API endpoint.

==== Request parameters
[width="100%" cols="2,4"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Parameter|Description
|`source_branch_name`|__String__. Name of the source branch from which changes need to be picked for validation.
|`target_branch_name`|__String__. Name of the target branch into which the TML changes will be merged.
||
|=====

==== Request example

The following example shows the API request with Liveboard and Worksheet objects to commit to Git.

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/branches/validate' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {Bearer_token}\
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "source_branch_name": "dev",
  "target_branch_name": "main"
}'
----

==== Results

After validating the merge, check for conflicts. Resolve issues if any with a new commit and merge your changes to the `main` branch.

=== Deploy commits

To deploy commits to the `Staging` or `Prod` instance, send a `POST` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy` API endpoint. The API will deploy the head of the branch unless a `commit_id` is specified in the API request.

Building a release version for a `Prod` environment on the same instance requires swapping in the correct GUIDs. If you have enabled xref:_guid_mapping[GUID mapping] in the Git configuration on your deployment instance, the version control APIs will automatically generate a GUID mapping file and update object references when deploying your commits to the destination environment.

[NOTE]
====
Parallel deployment to multiple organizations within a single cluster is not supported. Developers must run deployments to each organization sequentially.
====

////
Make sure the *guid mapping file* is referenced when creating the final TML files for production rollout.
////

==== Request parameters
[width="100%" cols="2,4"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Parameter|Description
|`commit_id` +
__Optional__|__String__. ID of the commit to deploy on the cluster. By default, the command will deploy the head of the branch. To deploy a specific version, specify the `commit_id`.
|`branch_name` |__String__. Name of the branch from which the commit must be picked for deployment. If you do not specify the branch name, the commit from the default branch is deployed.
|`deploy_type` a| __String__. Specify one of the following options: +

* `DELTA` (default) +
Deploys only the changes that were applied at the specified `commit_id`. For example, if three TML files were updated in the `commit_id` specified in the API request, only those changes will be deployed.
* `FULL` +
Deploys all the files in the Git branch, including the files from the `commit_id` specified in the request and all other files that were already committed.

|`deploy_policy` a|__String__. Action to apply when deploying a commit. The allowed values are: +

* `ALL_OR_NONE` (Default) +
Deploys all changes or none. This option cancels the deployment of all ThoughtSpot objects if at least one of them fails to import.
* `PARTIAL` +
Deploys partial objects. This option imports the subset of ThoughtSpot objects that validate successfully even if other objects in the same deploy operations fail to import.
* `VALIDATE_ONLY` +
Runs validation to detect if your destination environment can import the changes without conflicts. Use this when the TML content is modified between source and destination environments and if you do not want the TML content in your destination branch to be modified after a pull request from your dev branch.
||

==== Request example

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/vcs/git/commits/deploy' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {Bearer_token}'\
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "deploy_type": "DELTA",
  "deploy_policy": "ALL_OR_NONE",
  "commit_id": "afc0fea831558e30d7064ab019f49243b1f09552",
  "branch_name": "main"
}'
----

==== Results

If the API request is successful, the changes are applied to the objects in the `prod` environment. A tracking file is generated in the Git branch used for storing configuration files. This file includes the `commit_id` specified in the API request.

The subsequent API calls to deploy commits will consider the saved `commit_id` and `deploy_type` specified in the API request:

* If `deploy_type` is set as `DELTA`, all the changes between the last tracked `commit id` and the new `commit_id` specified in the API request will be deployed to the destination environment or Org.
* If the `deploy_type` is  FULL`, all the files from the `commit_id` specified in the API request will be deployed. If any object or file is deleted in the commit specified in the API request, it will be deleted from the destination environment during deployment.
