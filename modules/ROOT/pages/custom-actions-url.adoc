:page-description: You can add a custom action to send data to a specific URL target

ThoughtSpot allows you to add a custom action to trigger a data payload to a specific URL target. For example, you may search in ThoughtSpot for specific data and want to programmatically deliver this data to an external application or web page. ThoughtSpot Developer portal allows developers to add a custom menu item in the visualization pages and trigger a data push workflow when a user clicks the action.

== Create a URL action

Before you begin: 

* Make sure you have the developer or admin privileges to create a custom action.
* If a URL action is intended to be used by the embedded ThoughtSpot user, add the URL to the xref:security-settings.adoc[CORS and CSP connect-src allowlist].

To create a URL action, complete the following steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Custom actions*.
. Click *Create action*.
. Add a label for the custom action. For example, __Send Email__.
. Make sure the *URL* option is selected.
. Add the target URL that you want to invoke when a user clicks this action in the UI.
+
[NOTE]
====
The URL-based custom actions do not support the `localhost` hostname. Therefore, use the IP address `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` when specifying the target URL.
====

+
Note that the custom action ID is generated automatically. 

+
. To view additional settings, click *Show URL settings*.
. From the *Authorization* drop-down, select an authentication method. ThoughtSpot will use the specified authentication method to invoke the URL or make an API call.
+
[IMPORTANT]
The authentication information you specify in these fields is visible to other authenticated users, even if they do not have Developer or Admin privileges.

None::
If you do not want to use an authentication method, select `None`. 

Basic authentication::
Select this authentication method if your server requires ThoughtSpot to pass the authentication information, such as `username` and `password` in the `Authorization` header. If selected, enter the `username` and `password`.

Bearer::
Select this authentication method if your server requires ThoughtSpot to obtain a security token and send the token in the `Authorization` headers during an API call. Specify the security `token` to use for authentication and authorization.  

API key::
Select this authentication method if you want ThoughtSpot to use an API key during API calls to the URL target. Specify the API key value to use in the `X-API-Key` request header. 

+
. If the URL endpoint requires specific data for the custom action workflow, you can configure the action to send these attributes as query parameters. For example, you may want to send database information in query parameters to the URL endpoint when the action workflow is triggered. Make sure these query parameters are defined as key-value pairs.
 
. To add this action to all visualizations and saved Answer pages, select *On by default on all visualizations*.
+
If you do not select this checkbox, the URL action will be set as a *Local* action.  

. To restrict action availability to specific user groups, click *Show advanced availability settings*, and select the groups.      
 
. Click *Create action*.
+
The custom action is added to the *Actions* dashboard in the Developer portal.

. To view the custom action you just created, navigate to a visualization or saved Answer page.

== Initiate a URL action

To initiate a URL action:

. Navigate to a Liveboard visualization or saved Answer page, and click the URL action.
+
Custom actions appear as disabled on unsaved charts and tables. If you have generated a chart or table from a new search query, you must save the Answer to use the custom action.

. When you click the action, a POST request is sent to the specified URL target with the Answer or visualization data.
