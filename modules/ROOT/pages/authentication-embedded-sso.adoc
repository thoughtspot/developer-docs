== Embedded SSO authentication

Embedded SSO authentication simplifies the authentication process for embedded applications. The Embedded SSO method allows you to leverage your existing IdP setup and the SAML or OIDC configuration on ThoughtSpot. If enabled in the SDK, this authentication method seamlessly redirects users to their IdP within the ThoughtSpot iframe when ThoughtSpot content loads in the embedded app.
