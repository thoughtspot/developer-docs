:page-description:  Use the Robe-based access control feature for granular access control

ThoughtSpot administrators can assign granular privileges to users with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The RBAC feature is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your cluster, contact ThoughtSpot Support. Note that once you enable RBAC, it cannot be disabled.
====

== Roles and privileges

A `Role` is a collection of privileges that determines users' access to ThoughtSpot objects and workflows. Roles can be high-level, like Super Admin, or specific based on your organization’s structure and requirements.

When the RBAC feature is enabled on your instance, administrators can grant granular privileges and thus implement fine-grained access control to ThoughtSpot features, objects, and metadata.

For example, on ThoughtSpot instances with no RBAC, members of the groups with administration privileges can view and administer users, groups, and roles. With RBAC, you can assign granular privileges and restrict application-wide access only to super admin users.

|====
|ThoughtSpot privilege (without RBAC)|ThoughtSpot RBAC Roles
|__Can administer ThoughtSpot__ +

This privilege grants administration permissions to manage users and groups on instances that do not have the RBAC feature enabled. a|RBAC allows multiple Roles with granular privileges for administration control:

* User administration: __Can manage Users__
* Group administration: __Can manage Groups__
* Role administrator: __Can manage Roles__
* Org administration: __Can manage Orgs__
* Authentication administration: __Can manage Authentication__
* Application administration: __Can manage Application settings__

For a complete list of Roles and privileges, see xref:roles.adoc#_role_privileges[Role categories and privileges].
|====

== Role assignment
Administrators can create a Role with a specific set of privileges and assign this Role to a group via UI or REST API calls. Users inherit Role privileges from the groups to which they are assigned. To assign a Role to a user, administrators must assign the Role to a group and ensure that the intended users are added to this group.

The following figure illustrates the Role and Group assignment in ThoughtSpot:

[NOTE]
====
Roles are unique to an Org and can be created only within the context of an Org.
====

== Role categories and privileges

The RBAC feature groups access privileges under specific categories for granular access control and ease of use. You can create a role with a specific privilege from any role category and assign it to a group.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All ThoughtSpot instances include a *Super Admin* role with `ADMINISTRATION` privilege by default. The Super admin user can access and modify users, Groups, and Roles, and has all other privileges. If the Orgs feature is enabled on your instance, the `Super admin` user can create and manage Orgs and configure multi-tenancy. The `Super admin` role cannot be assigned, modified, or deleted.

|===

== Migrating to RBAC
The Role privileges function in the same way as group privileges. When RBAC is enabled, the corresponding group privileges are automatically migrated to Role privileges.
For example, if a group has `DATADOWNLOADING` access, the `DATADOWNLOADING` Role privilege will be assigned to the group after RBAC is enabled. Similarly, if a group has `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) access, the following Role privileges will be assigned to the group:

* *Can manage custom calendars* (`CAN_MANAGE_CUSTOM_CALENDAR`)
* *Can create/edit Connections* (`CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS`)
* *Can manage data models* (`CAN_MANAGE_WORKSHEET_VIEWS_TABLES`)

For granular access, you can create a Role with required privileges and assign it to groups.
