:page-description:  Use the Robe-based access control feature for granular access control

With Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [beta betaBackground]^Beta^, ThoughtSpot administrators can assign and manage granular privileges to users. A `Role` is a collection of privileges that determine users' access to ThoughtSpot objects and workflows.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The RBAC feature is in beta and is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your cluster, contact ThoughtSpot Support. Note that once you enable RBAC, it cannot be disabled.
====

== How it works

If the RBAC feature is enabled on your instance, administrators can grant granular privileges and thus implement fine-grained access control to ThoughtSpot features, objects, and metadata. For example, on ThoughtSpot instances with no RBAC, members of the groups with administration privileges can view, edit, and manage users, groups, and all metadata objects of ThoughtSpot. With RBAC, you can assign granular privileges such as user administration, group administration, application administration and so on, and restrict application-wide access only to super admin users.

Administrators can create a Role with a specific set of privileges and assign this Role to a group via UI or REST API calls. Users inherit Role privileges from the groups to which they are assigned. To assign a Role to a user, administrators must assign the Role to a group and ensure that the intended users are added to this group.

The following figure illustrates Role and Group assignment in ThoughtSpot:

[NOTE]
====
Roles are unique to an Org and can be created only within the context of an Org.
====

== Role privileges

The RBAC feature groups access privileges under specific categories for granular access control and ease of use:

=== Admin control
Includes Role privileges that allow administrative access to create and manage ThoughtSpot objects such as users, groups, and Roles.

|===
|Role type|Privilege|Description

|Super admin | `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**)|
Every ThoughtSpot instance includes a *Super Admin* Role by default. Users with super admin privilege can access and modify users, groups, Roles and all metadata objects on ThoughtSpot.
The super admin privilege cannot be modified or deleted and should be granted to users only in exceptional circumstances.
NOTE: If the Orgs feature is enabled on your instance, users with super admin privilege can create and manage Orgs and configure multi-tenancy.
|Role administration| `ROLE_ADMINISTRATION` (**Can manage Roles**) | Allows administrators to create, edit, and manage Roles vis UI or REST API calls.
|User administration |`USER_ADMINISTRATION` (**Can manage users**) | Allows administrators to create, edit, and manage users via UI or REST API calls.
|Group administration |`GROUP_ADMINISTRATION` (**Can manage Groups**)| Allows administrators to create, edit, and manage groups via UI or REST API calls.
|Org administration| `ORG_ADMINISTRATION` (**Can manage Orgs**) | Applicable to ThoughtSpot instances with Orgs. Users with `ORG_ADMINISTRATION` privilege can create and manage metadata objects, groups, and users in their respective Orgs.

This privilege is applicable only to instances that have an xref:get-started-tse.adoc[embedding license].

|===

== Migrating to RBAC
The Role privileges function in the same way as group privileges. When RBAC is enabled, the corresponding group privileges are automatically migrated to Role privileges. For example, a group with `DATAMANAGEMENT` privilege will be assigned `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) Role privilege. For granular access, you can create a Role with required privileges and assign it to groups.
