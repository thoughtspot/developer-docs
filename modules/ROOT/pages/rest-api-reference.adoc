Starting from the ThoughtSpot Cloud ts8.nov.cl and ThoughtSpot Software 8.4.1.sw releases, pinboards are rebranded as *Liveboards* in ThoughtSpot UI, documentation, and learning resources.
Note that the `pinboard` and `PINBOARD_ANSWER_BOOK` terminology in REST API v1 endpoint URLs, request and response workflows are not rebranded.
