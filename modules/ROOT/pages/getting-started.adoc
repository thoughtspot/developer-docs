The ThoughtSpot Visual Embed SDK is a JavaScript library that enables you to embed ThoughtSpot components in web pages. The library provides modular packages for embedding ThoughtSpot functions such as search, visualizations, Liveboards, and the full ThoughtSpot application.

This section lists the tasks you need to complete before embedding ThoughtSpot content in your applications.

== Adjust CORS and CSP allowed domains
By default, ThoughtSpot is configured to only allow embedding and REST API commands from specified domains.

If you encounter any errors with using the Visual Embed SDK components, verify if your host application domain is xref:security-settings.adoc[whitelisted for CORS and CSP] in the *Develop* > *Security Settings* page.

== Enable Developer Portal access
ThoughtSpot users can access Developer Portal via *Develop* tab in the UI.

Only administrators and users with `Developer` privilege can access the *Develop* tab. Please have your administrator add any users who will be developing embedded solutions to a ThoughtSpot group with *Has Developer privilege*.

For more information, see xref:user-roles.adoc[Developer access].

== Prepare your project environment
The Visual Embed SDK is available for installation as a Node Package Manager (NPM) package. Make sure the link:https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[NPM is installed, window=_blank] in your environment.

You can also access Visual Embed SDK, including information about how to install from NPM or run from a web repository, in the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk[ThoughtSpot Visual Embed SDK GitHub repository, window=_blank].

== Install the Visual Embed SDK
The latest version of the Visual Embed SDK is available at link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk, window=_blank].

To install the SDK, run the following command at the command line:
[source,console]
----
npm install @thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk
----

== Import embed package

Based on integration requirements, import any of the following embed modules and build your code.

SearchEmbed::

Use this package to xref:embed-search.adoc[embed the ThoughtSpot search page components].
+
The **SearchEmbed** component allows you to embed the search bar and data panel. You can load it with a pre-selected data source and let your users define search keywords or show a set of example search tokens on load, either from a data source or an existing saved Answer. +
+
In all cases, the search bar will appear along with full capabilities to edit search tokens and the resulting chart or table.

SearchBarEmbed::

Use this package to xref:embed-searchbar.adoc[embed only the Search bar].

+
The **SearchBarEmbed** component allows you to embed only the ThoughtSpot Search bar and data panel. The embedded search bar is responsive and can be adjusted to fit the screen width of your app.

LiveboardEmbed::
Use this package to embed ThoughtSpot xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Liveboards].
+
You can use the **LiveboardEmbed** component to embed a full Liveboard with multiple answers, as well as a specific Answer on a Liveboard without the search bar. These answers are referred to as Liveboard visualizations. +
+
Although you can use a saved Answer as a data source in SearchEmbed, ThoughtSpot does not support embedding a saved Answer. However, you can embed a specific visualization from a Liveboard using the `liveboardId` and `vizId` properties of LiveboardEmbed.

AppEmbed::
Use this package to embed xref:full-embed.adoc[the full ThoughtSpot application].

[#initSdk]
== Initialize the SDK

After importing the package, specify the hostname or IP address of your ThoughtSpot application instance and the authentication type.

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.EmbeddedSSO,
});
----
thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.

include::{path}/embed-auth-config.adoc[]

== Prefetch static resources (Recommended)

To prefetch static resources and load your application fast, call the `prefetch` method by setting  `callPrefetch` attribute to `true` in the `init` code. Make sure you call prefetch before user login and cache static assets as early as possible.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

== Configure security and login parameters (Optional)

include::{path}/embed-config.adoc[]

== Embed objects
After you initialize the SDK, create embed object classes and define object properties. +
For more information about embedding ThoughtSpot app or its objects using SDK, see the following pages: +

* xref:embed-search.adoc[Embed Search page]
* xref:embed-searchbar.adoc[Embed Search bar]
* xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a Liveboard]
* xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a Liveboard visualization]
* xref:full-embed.adoc[Embed full ThoughtSpot app]

== Best practices for performance optimization

Use the recommended SDK version::

Always use the recommended SDK version. +
ThoughtSpot publishes a new version of the SDK for every major ThoughtSpot Cloud release. Make sure you review the xref:api-changelog.adoc[changelog] to know about the new features and enhancements, breaking changes, bug fixes, and deprecated features.

Use the appropriate embed package::

The SDK provides different packages for embedding ThoughtSpot components in your app. Choose the appropriate package that suits your requirement. For example, if you need to embed multiple visualizations, consider adding them to a Liveboard and embed that Liveboard in your app.

+
To avoid page scroll as visualizations load on a Liveboard, you can set the `fullHeight` property to `true` in the `LiveboardEmbed` code.

Call init early::

Call the `init` method as early as possible and complete authentication on application load.


Prefetch and cache resources::

Use the `prefetch` method in the SDK to xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[prefetch and cache] static resources required for loading the embedded components. Make sure you call the `prefetch` method before calling `init` and cache static assets as early as possible.

Cache query results::

To cache query results, tune the underlying data warehouse.
