:page-description: Apply filters to visualizations at runtime and pass them as URL parameters

Runtime filters allow you to apply filters on a Liveboard, Answer, visualization, or conversation session with Spotter. These filters are not persistent filters saved in the object, but are applied dynamically at runtime. You can use runtime filters to pre-filter content for your application users based on context and embedding app's requirements.

== Overview

Runtime filters can be applied using one of the following options:

* Via Visual Embed SDK +
Use the `runtimeFilters` property in the Visual Embed SDK for embedded objects. +
The SDK also provides host events to update filters.
* Via REST APIs
Use REST API requests to apply runtime overrides on Liveboard, Answer, or visualization data.
* Via URL query parameters +
Pass filter properties as query parameters in the URL.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The runtime filters operation returns an error if the URL exceeds 2000 characters.
* Attempting to override existing filter values with runtime filters while exporting a Liveboard will result in an error.
* If a Model has a column alias, do not use the alias in runtime filters. Instead, use the underlying base column name.
====

=== Runtime filter properties

A runtime filter consists of the following attributes:

column name::
__String__. Name of the column to filter on. For example, `item type` or `product`. This attribute is defined as `col1`, `col2`, `col3` in the object URLs and REST API requests, and as `columnName` in the `runtimeFilters` array in the Visual Embed SDK.

operator::
__String__. The xref:runtime-filters.adoc#rtOperator[runtime filter operator]. For example, `EQ` or `IN`. In the Visual Embed SDK, operators are specified as xref:runtime-filters.adoc#runtimeFilterOp[`operator`] in the `runtimeFilters` array, whereas in the object URLs and REST API requests, you can define the operator as `op1`, `op2`, and `op3`.

values::
__String, Integer, or Boolean__. The values to filter by. For example, if the column name is defined as `State`, the value can be the name of the state like `Michigan`.
+
This attribute is defined as `val1`, `val2`, `val3` in the object URLs and REST API requests, and as `values` in the `runtimeFilters` array in the Visual Embed SDK.
+
Some operators like `EQ` and `LE` accept a single operand, whereas `BW_INC_MAX`, `BW_INC_MIN`, `BW_INC`, `BW`, and `IN` accept multiple operands.


=== Supported data types

You can apply filters on these data types:

* VARCHAR
* BIGINT
* INT
* FLOAT
* DOUBLE
* BOOLEAN
* DATE
* DATE_TIME
* TIME

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the `DATE` and `DATE_TIME` data types, you must provide the date and time values in the Epoch time format. The Epoch time is also referred to as POSIX or Unix time. Epoch time is an integer value representing the number of seconds elapsed since 1 JAN 1970 00:00:00 UTC. You may have to convert time zones to calculate the appropriate timestamp.

For example, if you want to filter data for 2020-05-22, you can specify the date value in the Epoch time format as `1590192000`, or use the following JavaScript method to calculate the timestamp:

----
new Date('2020-05-22').getTime() / 1000

== Runtime filters in Visual Embed SDK

If you are embedding Spotter, Liveboard, visualization or the full application using Visual Embed SDK, you can apply filters using the `runtimeFilters` property. In the full app embed mode, ThoughtSpot applies runtime filters on all Liveboard, visualization, and Answer objects in the embedded app.

The following example shows how to apply runtime filters on an embedded visualization in the SDK. Here, the runtime filter is operating on the `Revenue` column to filter the data matching `100000`.

[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
    ... // other embed view config
    liveboardId: '133e6c5f-e522-41a0-b0ad-b9c3b066e276',
    vizId: '28b73b4a-1341-4535-ab71-f76b6fe7bf92',
    runtimeFilters: [{
        columnName: 'Revenue',
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
        values: ['100000']
    }]
});
----

In the following example, runtime filters are applied on a Spotter conversation session with a pre-defined search query string:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const spotterEmbed = new SpotterEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
    ... // other embed view config
    worksheetId: "cd252e5c-b552-49a8-821d-3eadaa049cca",
    searchOptions: {
        searchQuery: 'sales data for west coast',
    },
    runtimeFilters: [{
        columnName: 'Item type',
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
        values: ['jackets']
    }]
});
----

Spotter applies the specified filters to the data and returns an answer for the initial query passed in the embed code. Unless the filters are explicitly overridden, runtime filters will continue to be applied to all answers generated for subsequent queries within the same conversation session.

=== Applying multiple runtime filters

The following examples show how to apply multiple runtime filters on Liveboard visualizations using the SDK:

[#multiRuntimeFilters]
[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
    ... // other embed view config
    liveboardId: '543619d6-0015-4667-b257-eff547d13a12',
    runtimeFilters: [{
            columnName: 'item type', // eg: color
            operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
            values: ['Jackets'] // eg: red
        },
        {
            columnName: 'Region',
            operator: RuntimeFilterOp.IN,
            values: ['Midwest', 'East', 'West']
        },
        {
            columnName: 'Date',
            operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
            values: ['1656680400']
        }
    ]
});
----

=== AND and OR conditions in filters

If the Liveboard or Answer already has one or more filters applied, runtime filters will act as an `AND` condition. This means that all filter conditions, including those supplied in the runtime filters and Liveboard filter, must match to get the desired data.

In the following example, the OR condition is applied; That is, if at least one condition matches, the Liveboard returns data.

.Example for OR condition
[source,JavaScript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
    columnName: 'product name',
    operator: RuntimeFilterOp.CONTAINS,
    values: ['bag', 'jackets']
}]
----
However, when multiple runtime filters are applied, or when the Liveboard already has a filter applied, the data must match all filter conditions.

.Example for AND condition
[source,JavaScript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
        columnName: 'product name',
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.CONTAINS,
        values: ['vest']
    },
    {
        columnName: 'product name',
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.CONTAINS,
        values: ['hoody']
    }
]
----

=== Adjust runtime filters using SDK events
Runtime filters can be set prior to the load within the xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc#_runtimefilters[configuration object] of the loaded embed component:

[source,JavaScript]
----
 const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed('#embed-container', {
     ... // other options
     runtimeFilters: [{
         columnName: 'state',
         operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
         values: ['california'],
     }, ],
 })
----

After loading the embedded object, runtime filters can be adjusted using the xref:HostEvent.adoc#_updateruntimefilters[`HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters`] event:

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [{
        columnName: "state",
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
        values: ["michigan"]
    },
    {
        columnName: "item type",
        operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
        values: ["Jackets"]
    }
])
----

[NOTE]
====
Spotter embed does not support updating filters via host and embed events.
====

=== Apply runtime filters on embedded objects without the SDK

If you are xref:embed-without-sdk.adoc[embedding a Liveboard or visualization without using the Visual Embed SDK], you can append the filters in the embedded object URL as shown in these examples:

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?embedApp=true&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=michigan#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}
----

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?embedApp=true&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=michigan&col2=product&op2=BEGINS_WITH&val2=Travel#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}
----

==== URL format when embedding without SDK

If embedding a ThoughtSpot Liveboard without the SDK, ensure that add the runtime filters before `#/path` in the URL as shown in the following example:
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?embedApp=true&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=michigan#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}
----

For more information, see xref:embed-without-sdk.adoc[Embed without SDK].


== Runtime filters via REST APIs

=== REST API v2.0 endpoints

The v2.0 Data and Report endpoints support runtime filters in REST API requests. Note that you can add additional filters by incrementing the number at the end of each parameter: for example, col2, op2, val2. Some operators, such as `CONTAINS` and `IN`, allow passing multiple values in the `val` attribute.

=== REST API v1 endpoints

To apply runtime filters on a Liveboard object in a REST API request, add the runtime filters to the API request URL as shown here:

.URL format
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id={Liveboard_id}&col1={column-name}&op1={operator}&val1={value}
----

.Example
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=e36ee65e-64be-436b-a29a-22d8998c4fae&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California
----

The following example shows how to apply a runtime filter on a visualization object of a Liveboard:

.URL format
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id={Liveboard_id}&vizid={visualization_id}&col1={column-name}&op1={operator}&val1={value}
----

.Example
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=543619d6-0015-4667-b257-eff547d13a12&vizid=%5B%224ff5b939-453d-40ff-8fc2-a1d972047c86%22%5D&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California
----

The following is another example of a REST API request URL with a filter. Here the runtime filter is operating on the column `Category` and returning values that are equal to `mfgr%2324`.

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?
id=e36ee65e-64be-436b-a29a-22d8998c4fae&col1=Category
&op1=EQ&val1=mfgr%2324
----

==== Apply additional filters

You can add additional filters by incrementing the number at the end of each parameter in the runtime filter for each filter you add, for example, col2, op2, val2, and so on. To add additional filters on a particular column, you can specify multiple values by separating them with an ampersand (&) as shown in the example here:

----
val1=foo&val1=bar
----

You can also use the `IN` operator for multiple values, as shown in this example:

----
col1=<column_name>&op1=IN&val1=<value>&val1=<value>
----

The following example passes multiple variables to a single column as well as multiple columns. It shows that the data values are returned as epochs.

----
col1=region&op1=IN&val1=midwest&val1=south&val1=northeast&col2=date&op2=BET&val2=<epoch_start>&val2=<epoch_end>
----

== Apply runtime filters on a Liveboard or visualization URL

The following examples show the runtime filter query string in a Liveboard URL:

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a
----

You can apply multiple filters in the same URL, as shown in this example:
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California&col2=product&op2=BEGINS_WITH&val2=Travel#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a
----

You can also apply multiple filters with multiple values, as shown in this example:
----
https://<thoughtspot-host>/?col1=State&op1=IN&val1=California&val1=Michigan&col2=item%20type&op2=EQ&val2=Jackets#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a
----

////
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California&col2=product&op2=BEGINS_WITH&val2=Travel#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a
----
////

== Limitations of runtime filters

* The `DATE` and `DATE_TIME` data types must be specified as EPOCH time (Unix or POSIX time) in runtime filters.
* Runtime filters work only on Answers and Liveboard visualizations built from Models. Runtime filters on visualizations and Answers built directly from Tables, Views, and SQL Views do not work because the possibility of multiple join paths and join path choice is not supported as input in runtime filters.
* Runtime filters do not allow you to apply `HAVING` filters in the URL parameters.

////
* You cannot apply a runtime filter on a Liveboard or visualization built from Tables and Models that have chasm traps.

* Runtime filters do not work directly on top of tables. You must create a Model if you want to use runtime filters. This means that the Liveboard or visualization on which you apply a runtime filter must be created on top of a Model.

* If the Model was created from an Answer (it is an aggregated Model), runtime filters will only work if the Answer was formed using a single Model. If the Answer from which the Model was created includes raw tables or joins multiple Models, you won't be able to use runtime filters on it. This is because of the join path ambiguity that could result.
