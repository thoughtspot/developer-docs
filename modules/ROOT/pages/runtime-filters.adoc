:page-description: Apply filters to visualizations at runtime and pass them as URL parameters

Runtime filters provide the ability to apply filters to a Liveboard or Answer by passing filter properties as query parameters in a Liveboard or visualization URL. You can also apply runtime filters in REST API requests when querying data from a Liveboard, Answer, or a visualization object. On embedded instances, you can use the Visual Embed SDK to apply filters to an embedded Liveboard or Answer object, and also update filters using events.


[NOTE]
====
The runtime filters operation returns an error if the URL exceeds 2000 characters.
====

== How runtime filters work

The runtime filters can be specified in the ThoughtSpot object URL as query parameters. When you apply a runtime filter to a Liveboard, ThoughtSpot will try to find a matching column in the Liveboard visualizations to filter data. The runtime filter requires the following attribute-value pairs.

column name::
__String__. Name of the column to filter by. For example, `item type` or `product`. This attribute is defined as `col1`, `col2`, `col3` in the URLs and as `columnName` in the `runtimeFilters` array in the Visual Embed SDK.

operator::
__String__. The xref:runtime-filters.adoc#rtOperator[runtime filter operator]. For example, `EQ` or `IN`. This attribute is defined as `op1`, `op2`, `op3` in the object URLs and as xref:runtime-filters.adoc#runtimeFilterOp[`operator` in the `runtimeFilters` array] in the Visual Embed SDK.

values::
__String, Integer, or Boolean__. The list of operands. For example, if the column name is defined as `State`, the value can be the name of the state like `Michigan`.
+
This attribute is defined as `val1`, `val2`, `val3` in the object URLs and as `values` in the `runtimeFilters` array in the Visual Embed SDK.
+
Some operators like `EQ`, `LE` accept a single operand, whereas `BW_INC_MAX`, `BW_INC_MIN`, `BW_INC`, `BW`, and `IN` accept multiple operands.

=== Supported data types

You can apply runtime filters on these data types:

* VARCHAR
* BIGINT
* INT
* FLOAT
* DOUBLE
* BOOLEAN
* DATE
* DATE_TIME
* TIME

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the `DATE` and `DATE_TIME` data types, you must provide the date and time values in the Epoch time format. The Epoch time is also referred to as POSIX or Unix time. Epoch time is an integer value representing the number of seconds elapsed since 1 JAN 1970 00:00:00 UTC. You may have to convert time zones to calculate the appropriate timestamp.

For example, if you want to filter data for 2020-05-22, you can specify the date value in the Epoch time format as `1590192000`, or use the following JavaScript method to calculate the timestamp:

----
new Date('2020-05-22').getTime() / 1000
----

== Apply runtime filters on a Liveboard or visualization

The following examples show the runtime filter query string in a Liveboard URL:

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a?col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California
----

https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a
----

You can apply multiple filters in the same URL as shown in this example:

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/#/pinboard/d084c256-e284-4fc4-b80c-111cb606449a?col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California&col2=product&op2=BEGINS_WITH&val2=Travel

----
////

== Apply runtime filters on embedded objects

If you are xref:embed-without-sdk.adoc[embedding a Liveboard or visualization without using the Visual Embed SDK], you can append the filters in the embedded object URL as shown in these examples:

----
https://{ThoughtspotHost}/?embedApp=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}
&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=michigan
----
----
https://{ThoughtspotHost}/?embedApp=true#/embed/viz/{Liveboard_id}/{visualization_id}
&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=michigan&col2=product&op2=BEGINS_WITH&val2=Travel

=== Runtime filters in Visual Embed SDK

If you are embedding a Liveboard, visualization, or Answer using xref:visual-embed-sdk.adoc[Visual Embed SDK], you can apply filters using the `runtimeFilters` property. In the full app embed mode, ThoughtSpot applies runtime filters on all Liveboard, visualization, and Answer objects in the embedded app.

The following example shows how to apply runtime filters on an embedded visualization in the SDK. Here, the runtime filter is operating on the `Revenue` column to filter the data matching `100000`.

----
liveboardEmbed.render({
    liveboardId: '133e6c5f-e522-41a0-b0ad-b9c3b066e276',
    vizId: '28b73b4a-1341-4535-ab71-f76b6fe7bf92',
      runtimeFilters: [{
      columnName: 'Revenue',
      operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
      values: ['100000' ]
      }]
  });
----

=== Apply multiple runtime filters in the SDK

The following examples show how to apply multiple runtime filters on Liveboard visualizations using the SDK:

----
liveboardEmbed.render({
    liveboardId: '543619d6-0015-4667-b257-eff547d13a12',
    runtimeFilters: [{
            columnName: 'item type', // eg: color
            operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
            values: ['Jackets'] // eg: red
        },
        {
            columnName: 'Region',
            operator: RuntimeFilterOp.IN,
            values: ['Midwest', 'East', 'West']
        },
        {
            columnName: 'Date',
            operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
            values: ['1656680400']
        }
    ]
});

==== SDK Events

See xref:events-ref.adoc#_updateruntimefilters[UpdateRuntimeFilters] and xref:embed-events.adoc#_filters_in_embedded_ui[Filters in embedded UI].

== Apply runtime filters using REST API v1 endpoints

To apply runtime filters on a Liveboard object in a REST API request, add the runtime filters to the API request URL as shown here:

.URL format
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id={Liveboard_id}&col1={column-name}&op1={operator}&val1={value}
----

.Example
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=e36ee65e-64be-436b-a29a-22d8998c4fae&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California
----

The following example shows how to apply a runtime filter on a visualization object of a Liveboard:

.URL format
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id={Liveboard_id}&vizid={visualization_id}&col1={column-name}&op1={operator}&val1={value}
----

.Example
----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=543619d6-0015-4667-b257-eff547d13a12&vizid=%5B%224ff5b939-453d-40ff-8fc2-a1d972047c86%22%5D&col1=State&op1=EQ&val1=California
----

The following is another example of a REST API request URL with a filter. Here the runtime filter is operating on the column `Category` and returning values that are equal to `mfgr%2324`.

----
https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?
id=e36ee65e-64be-436b-a29a-22d8998c4fae&col1=Category
&op1=EQ&val1=mfgr%2324
----

=== Apply additional filters

You can add additional filters by incrementing the number at the end of each parameter in the runtime filter for each filter you add, for example, col2, op2, val2, and so on. To add additional filters on a particular column, you can specify multiple values by separating them with an ampersand (&) as shown in the example here:

----
val1=foo&val1=bar
----

You can also use the `IN` operator for multiple values, as shown in this example:

----
col1=<column_name>&op1=IN&val1=<value>&val1=<value>
----

The following example passes multiple variables to a single column as well as multiple columns. It shows that the data values are returned as epochs.

----
col1=region&op1=IN&val1=midwest&val1=south&val1=northeast&col2=date&op2=BET&val2=<epoch_start>&val2=<epoch_end>
----
[NOTE]
====
If the Liveboard or Answer you're filtering already has one or more filters applied, the runtime filters will act as an `AND` condition. This means that the data returned must meet the conditions of all filters; those supplied in the runtime filter and those included in the Liveboard or visualization itself.
====

== Apply Runtime filters in REST API v2 requests

The following v2.0 endpoints support runtime filters in REST API requests:

* `POST /api/rest/2.0/report/liveboard`
+
Allows downloading Liveboard data in PDF, XLSX, CSV, and PNG format

* `POST /api/rest/2.0/report/answer`
+
Allows downloading Answer data in PDF, XLSX, CSV, and PNG format

The following example shows the request body with runtime filter parameters:

.Answer report

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/report/answer' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access-token} '\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "metadata_identifier": "fa68ae91-7588-4136-bacd-d71fb12dda69",
  "file_format": "XLSX",
  "runtime_filter": {
    "col1": "item type",
    "op1": "EQ",
    "values": "Jackets"
  }
}'
----

.Liveboard report

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/report/liveboard' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access-token} '\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "metadata_identifier": "fa68ae91-7588-4136-bacd-d71fb12dda69",
  "file_format": "PDF",
  "runtime_filter": {
    "col1": "item type",
    "op1": "EQ",
    "values": "Jackets"
  }
}'
----

== Limitations of runtime filters

* The `DATE` and `DATE_TIME` data type must be specified as EPOCH time (Unix or POSIX time) in runtime filters.
* Runtime filters do not work directly on top of tables. You must create a Worksheet if you want to use runtime filters. This means that the Liveboard or visualization on which you apply a runtime filter must be created on top of a Worksheet.
* If the Worksheet was created from an Answer (it is an aggregated Worksheet), runtime filters will only work if the Answer was formed using a single Worksheet. If the Answer from which the Worksheet was created includes raw tables or joins multiple worksheets, you won't be able to use runtime filters on it. This is because of the join path ambiguity that could result.
* Runtime filters do not allow you to apply `HAVING` filters in the URL parameters.
* You cannot apply a runtime filter on a Liveboard or visualization built from tables and worksheets that have chasm traps.
