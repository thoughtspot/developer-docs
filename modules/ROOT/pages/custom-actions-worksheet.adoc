:page-description: Add custom actions to Models

ThoughtSpot supports adding custom actions to the visualizations generated from a specific Model. The local custom actions created in the Developer portal appear on the Model page, so that you can assign these actions to the new visualizations built from that Model.

[NOTE]
====
When you assign a custom action to a Model, ThoughtSpot adds it to the Answers generated from that Model.
====

== Before you begin

* Make sure the custom actions are set as *Local*. 
* Make sure you have edit permissions to modify the Model.
* Make sure the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/answer-experience-new[new Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster.

== Assign a custom action to a Model

To add a custom action to a Model:

. Go to *Data* > *Data Objects* > *Models*.
. Click the Model that you want to modify.
. Click the *Custom actions* tab.
+
A list of custom actions available on your instance is displayed. 

. Note that the page shows the global custom actions that appear on all visualizations by default. These actions will be available on all answers generated from the Model.

. To assign a local custom action to a Model:
.. Click *Add action*.
.. Select the custom action that you want to add.
.. To specify the position of the action, select one of the following options:
* *Primary*
+
Sets the custom action as a primary menu action.
+
[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot allows only one primary action on a visualization page. If visualizations generated from the Model already have a primary action, the new configuration overrides this setting.

If a visualization built from this Model already has a primary action added locally at the visualization level, ThoughtSpot will retain this configuration and does not apply the primary action added at the Model level.
====

* *Menu*
+
Adds the custom action to the  **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu].

* *Context menu*
+
Adds the custom action as a menu item in the contextual menu. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set from a visualization, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu. Users can access this action in the contextual menu by right-clicking on a visualization.

+
. Preview the position of the custom action.

. Click *Save*.
+
The custom action will be added to all Answers generated from this Model.

== Verify the custom action placement

. To view the action you just added, click *Home*.
. Set your Model as the data source, specify search tokens, and click **Go**.
+
. Verify if the action is added to the visualization page.
