:page-description: Single-tenant data models are deployed in a prod Org per end customer model

A data model pattern is "single-tenanted" to ThoughtSpot if some aspects of the database connection or actual tables are different enough to require separate objects in ThoughtSpot for each tenant, often called *logical separation*.

Logical separation might be caused by:

- Separate data warehouse credentials or other attributes
- Different databases
- Different schemas

or any other set of attributes that amount to either *different connections* or *different Table objects* in ThoughtSpot.

== "Prod" environments for single-tenant data models
Rather than a single multi-tenanted "prod" environment, the deployment pattern for single-tenanted customer databases is to have a "release" or "pre-prod" environment and then *one Prod Org Per Customer*.

The initial processes and environments resemble a multi-tenanted prod deployment:

Once content has been deployed succesfully to the "release" or "pre-prod" Org, then the release to each of the end customer prod Orgs can begin:

This process is best achieved through using the xref:version_control.adoc[Git Integration REST APIs], which can support any number of configurations for any number of environments.

== Single-tenant data models
The "single-tenant data model" is designed on the following principles:

* Each customer organization has its own database to connect to, with only that customer organization’s data present when making the database connection. Every database is similar in structure (table names and column names / data types).
* Multiple customer organizations in ThoughtSpot
* Content (answers and Liveboards) are provided by the app developer in the form of templates
* Users within the customer organizations can create their own content, and can share it with other users within their own organizations only

If you have the choice between designing your cloud data warehouse along single-tenant or multi-tenant model, it will be simpler to implement in ThoughtSpot using the multi-tenant model.

=== Content provided by app developer
Single-tenant databases require separate connections in ThoughtSpot for each database in most cases. There will then be separate objects on the ThoughtSpot Server for each connection. Because all of the objects other than the connection will be very similar, the deployment pattern can be handled through templating: there will be a set of template objects which are deployed for each tenant.

We can describe the template as the parent content, with child objects that descend from the template.

The template content itself will be built by the app developer, but will not be accessible to the customer organizations. Instead, there will be a deployment process that copies the template content and makes the necessary changes, and then publishes to the appropriate group for each customer.

=== Content provided by app developer to each tenant group
Each tenant should have a group used to give access to the content provided by the app developer—a tenant application group. Only the application developer would publish content to this group, and it should be set to *NOT SHAREABLE*.

=== Content belonging to individual tenants
To allow users to create their own content and share only within their organization, you will create at least one group for each tenant, separate from the application tenant group. This group can be set to *SHAREABLE*, or you may want additional groups below the main tenant group, representing different sets of users who belong to that tenant, and then make those child groups the ones that are *SHAREABLE*.

=== Summary of access groups for single-tenant databases model
The following table lists the access groups needed for this model. There will also be privilege groups, data access groups, and development and test content groups. You can name the groups anything you'd like, with a naming scheme that makes sense to you. The "group type" names here are just indications of the purpose of those groups.

Reminder: when a group is set to *NOT SHAREABLE*, administrators can still share content to that group. *NOT SHAREABLE* groups are used for the content provided by the app developer to end users.
