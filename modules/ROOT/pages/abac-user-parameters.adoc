:page-description: Attribute-based access control pattern can be achieved via user parameters sent in the login token

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is a pattern where security entitlements are sent in as lists of attributes at session creation time via the authentication service.

ThoughtSpot 10.4 and later implements ABAC for row-level security via the xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[/auth/token/custom REST API endpoint].

The most common *best practice* for ABAC is to define *filter rules* within the token and place the `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` property on every column in a Worksheet or Model where a filter rule is expected.

This will deny any access to data if a user has not been assigned values for the expected set of fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[#beta-warning]
// * RLS using ABAC via tokens is in __Beta__. As this feature directly impacts data security in your environment, ThoughtSpot does not support its use in a Production environment until it becomes Generally Available. ThoughtSpot is working on improvements in the upcoming releases that will change some of the best practices recommended in this article and result in the needed re-work of your deployment's security architecture. To understand the RLS best practices for your use case and  deployment timelines, and to get these features enabled on your ThoughtSpot instances, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

// * The ABAC via tokens method requires using link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/worksheet-create[Worksheets, target=_blank] or link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/models[Models, window=_blank] as data sources for Liveboards and Answers, rather than individual table objects.

The `user_parameters` property in `auth/token/full` and `token/object` APIs used for the *BETA* of ABAC  is *deprecated* in 10.4.0.cl. 

To migrate your implementation from the BETA version of ABAC using the V2.0 Get token APIs (`auth/token/full` or `auth/token/object`) to `auth/token/custom` API workflow, refer to the instructions in the xref:jwt-migration.adoc[migration guide].

// If your ThoughtSpot instance is on 10.4.0.cl or a later version, we recommend using the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom</a>+++ API endpoint to xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[generate a token with custom rules and user properties].  +
// The examples in this article show `user_properties` defined in the beta version of the ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API endpoint. If your instance is on 10.4.0.cl or a later version, you can start using the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint to xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[configure filter rules and persist options] +

== Overview

The following attributes can be set for a user via the custom login token, along with the capability to assign ThoughtSpot groups:

* xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Filter rules] +
Can filter multiple values of any data type. Binds to any Column in any Model or Worksheet with a matching Column Name (ThoughtSpot property, not underlying database table column name).

* xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[Parameter values] +
Binds a single value to any Parameter in any Worksheet or Model by Parameter Name and Type match. Parameters can be used in *worksheet formulas* and then as *worksheet filters*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[#column-name-warning]
The filter rules require passing the *exact* ThoughtSpot Worksheet or Model column name the values will not bind to any column. 

You must coordinate between the team that maintains the worksheets and models and the team that builds the xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] if any changes will be made to a model or worksheet.

For the same reasons, end users of an embedded app cannot have *edit* access to any worksheet or model using ABAC RLS via tokens.
====

The request for a token with ABAC details can xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc#persistForUser[persist] the set of filters and Parameter values to the user within ThoughtSpot, after which all sessions and scheduled reports will use the persisted values until they are changed by another token request.

== Token request
The ABAC message to ThoughtSpot is encoded in JSON Web Token (JWT) format, using the existing ThoughtSpot V2.0 REST API access tokens, which are OAuth JWT tokens.

The token can be used as a bearer token for cookieless Trusted Auth or REST API access, or as a sign-in token to create a ThoughtSpot session, in which case the ABAC user parameters should be *persisted*.

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot compresses the size of JWT token by default to ensure that larger payloads, for instance, more complex filtering conditions can be passed via JWT. ThoughtSpot recommends leaving that compression on to ensure all JWT tokens can get properly interpreted by the application regardless of their size, and to obfuscate the values passed in the JWT payload. However, if you want to decode the JWT token and decode the values of the token (at the expense of compression), contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====

=== Request format
// UPDATE THIS TO REFLECT THE CUSTOM ENDPOINT

The ABAC request is sent using the `user_parameters` key of the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-full-access-token[V2.0 Full Access Token request, target=_blank].

There are three potential keys within `user_parameters`, each taking an array of objects:
[code,javascript]
----
...
"user_parameters": {
   "runtime_filters": [],
   "parameters" : [],
   "runtime_sorts": []
}
----

The format for the objects in each section follows the equivalent formats in the Visual Embed SDK for xref:runtime-filters.adoc[runtime filters], xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[runtime parameters], or xref:runtime-sort.adoc[runtime sorts].

There is a `xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc#persistForUser[persist]` key to be added on each object that takes a boolean `true` or `false`. This determines if the values are persisted at the user level beyond just the token itself, for features such as alerts and subscriptions that run outside a user's session.

The following is a `user_parameters` section that would be part of the JSON request of the link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-full-access-token[V2.0 Full Access Token request, target=_blank]:

[source,JavaScript]
----
"user_parameters": {
   "runtime_filters": [
      {
        "column_name": "Region",
        "operator": "IN",
        "values": ["West", "Southwest"],
        "persist": false
      },
      {
        "column_name": "Product Type",
        "operator": "IN",
        "values": ["Shirts", "Swimwear"],
        "persist": true
      }
    ],
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "Secured",
        "values": ["rxzricmwfe87q7bh7jyg"],
        "persist": true
      }
    ]
  }
----

=== Apply to specific objects
By default, any specified filter or parameter will bind to *any content* with an exact match for the column or parameter name.

You can choose the filter or parameter to apply only to specific ThoughtSpot objects by including an `objects` section with the following format:

[source,JavaScript]
----
"runtime_filters": [
   {
     "column_name": "Region",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["West", "Southwest"],
     "persist": false
     "objects": [
         {
           // example of the format
           "type": "{OBJECT_TYPE}",
           "identifier": "{id or name of the object}"
         },
         {
            "type":"LIVEBOARD",
            "identifier": "9bd202f5-d431-44bf-9a07-b4f7be372125"

         }
      ]
]
----

[#persistForUser]
=== Token-based override vs. persisting values
When `persist: false` is chosen for an ABAC attribute, it only acts as an *override*, with the values tied only to the specific token.

You can treat the REST API *token request* with any values where `persist: true` as "update user_parameters" API endpoint, even if you don't use the token in the response.

Filters and parameters must be *persisted* for them to apply when using xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#cookie[cookie-based trusted authentication] or scheduled reports.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|=====
|persist|authentication type|behavior

|`false`
|Cookieless Trusted Auth
|Token values override user's values, without updating user_parameters

|`true`
|Cookieless Trusted Auth
|Token values override, but user_parameters is also updated by token request

|`true`
|Cookie-based Trusted Auth
|Token request updates user_parameters, token is used by SDK to start a session

|`true`
|Discard token after request
|Token request updates user_parameters

|=====

Remember, the successful *request* for a token updates the stored `user_parameters` property of the user, rather than the first use of the token.

Persisting values opens up use cases for ABAC outside of the cookieless Trusted Authentication pattern: even if users authenticate via SAML, OIDC, or go directly into ThoughtSpot via username and password, an administrator can make a token request with `persist: true` to set their stored `user_parameters`.

=== Remove persisted values
The syntax to fully remove persisted elements in a user's `user_parameters` property is to pass an *empty array* for the category.

A request with an empty array affects persisted values despite there being no `persist` key within the request.

The following would clear *all* persisted values of any type:
[code,javascript]
----
"user_parameters": {
   "runtime_filters": [],
   "parameters" : [],
   "runtime_sorts": []
}
----

== Filter rules for multi-value RLS
The ABAC via tokens pattern allows for setting arbitrary filters and overriding the values of existing worksheet parameters. These two capabilities can be combined in a number of ways to create secure and unbreakable RLS.


=== Deny All by default
Starting in ThoughtSpot 10.4, you can add `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` to the TML definition of any column in a worksheet or model.

ThoughtSpot checks to see if the logged in user has any *filter_rules* defined for a column marked with `is_mandatory_filter: true`, and denies access to any data if a filter_rule for the matching column is not found.

=== Show All 
The way to show all values for a column protected by `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` is to pass the special keyword `["TS_WILDCARD_ALL"]` as the value for the column in the *filter_rules*.

Columns without `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` will show all values if there is no *filter_rule* for that column. 


=== Build the ABAC token request
The xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] must have the following to build a token request for ABAC:

1. Filter rules for defining multi-value conditions on columns
2. Parameter values for use in Worksheet or Model formulas

The filter rules must be built by:

1. Retrieving user data entitlements
2. Translating entitlements into ThoughSpot *filter rules*

==== Retrieve entitlements
The value of the ABAC pattern is that you can send different combinations of filters for different types of users.

You can retrieve the attribute names and values from any source: the embedding application's session details, an entitlement REST API, a query to a different database, etc.

==== Translate entitlements into filter rules

Filter rules *match on the name property of a column* as defined in ThoughtSpot, not the column's name in the underlying database table. 

The xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] *MUST* know the ThoughtSpot column names that will be used for each of the attributes, so you'll need to coordinate between ThoughtSpot Worksheet designers and the xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] to make sure the matching column names and values are being sent.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[#dev-deploy-warning]
End users of an embedded app cannot have *edit* access to any worksheet using ABAC RLS via tokens.

You must follow xref:development-and-deployment.adoc[proper development and deployment practices] for all your customer-facing production environments as well as the production token request service.
====

As mentioned in the preceding section, the format for filter rules within the token match with xref:runtime-filters.adoc[runtime filters] in the Visual Embed SDK. In general, RLS entitlements are lists of values using the `IN` operator, but you can pass in filters on numeric and time columns using the full set of operators.

All values are passed into the token as *arrays of strings*, even if the column is a numeric, boolean, or date type in ThoughtSpot and the database. The column data type will be respected in the query issued to the database.

For example, let's assume three attributes that are needed to filter down a user on a multi-tenanted database: `Customer ID`, `Region`, and `Product Type`.

The following is what the token request would look like if restricting on all three attributes:

[source,JavaScript]
----
"filter_rules": [
   {
     "column_name" : "Customer ID",
     "operator": "EQ",
     "values": ["492810"]
  },
   {
     "column_name": "Region",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["West", "Southwest"]
   },
   {
     "column_name": "Product Type",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["Shirts", "Swimwear"]
   }
 ]
----

A user might be entitled to *all access* on any given column (you might drop some levels of a hierarchy if you include more granular columns to filter on for that user).

The following is a request where a different user can see all `Region`, but still has restrictions on `Customer ID` and `Product Type`, using the `TS_WILDCARD_ALL` value to allow data even when the column expects a filter from the token:
[code,javascript]
----
"runtime_filters": [
   { 
     "column_name" : "Customer ID",
     "operator": "EQ",
     "values": ["TS_WILDCARD_ALL"]
   },
   {
     "column_name" : "Customer ID",
     "operator": "EQ",
     "values": ["492810"],
     "persist" : true
  },
   {
     "column_name": "Product Type",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["Shirts", "Swimwear"],
     "persist": true
   }
 ]
----

Because the `runtime_filters` section is entirely within the control of the *token request service*, you have full flexibility to generate any set of filters for any type of user within the token.


== Parameters to filter a Worksheet via Formulas
The basic pattern for using a Parameter to filter a Worksheet or Model includes these steps:

. Create link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/parameters-create[Parameters, target=_blank] in Worksheet
. Make link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/formulas[formula, target=_blank] that evaluates the Parameter's default value and the expected values from the token
. Make link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/filters#_worksheet_filters[Worksheet filter, target=_blank] based on the formula, set to *true*.

link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/parameters-create[Parameters, target=_blank] are defined at the Worksheet level within ThoughtSpot. Parameters have a data type and a default value set by the Worksheet author.

There is also the ability to add `is_hidden: true` to a Parameter definition using TML, which allows the flexibility to use as many parameters as desired for any type of formula to be used as a worksheet filter, without it cluttering the visible UI.

To use a Parameter, you'll make a link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/formulas[formula, target=_blank] on the Worksheet.

link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/filters#_worksheet_filters[Worksheet filters, target=_blank] can reference Worksheet formulas once they have been created, which creates the security layer out of the result of the formula.

All of these Worksheet-level features are set by clicking *Edit* on the Worksheet, then expanding the menu on the left sidebar:

[.widthAuto]
image::./images/worksheet_edit_sidebar.png[Worksheet Edit Sidebar]

==== Create the Worksheet security formula
A Parameter doesn't do anything on its own. You need a formula to evaluate the Parameter's value.

Any security formula to be used on a worksheet should result in a *boolean* true or false, and then the worksheet filter will be set to only return data when the formula returns true.

===== Logic for groups to see all data
In any security formula you build, you may want a clause that gives access to all data to certain groups.

You can chain together any number of `if...then...else` clauses within a formula, including using the `ts_groups` or `ts_username` values, to build out your preferred logic:

`if ( 'data developers' in ts_groups ) then true else if ( parameter_name = field_name ) then true else false`

===== Formulas comparing a parameter to a column
Parameters can be used in a formula to directly match a value in a column, or any other type of function you'd like to use:

`if ( parameter_name = field_name ) then true else false`

===== Use Parameters with pass-through functions
link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/formula-reference#passthrough-functions[ThoughtSpot SQL Pass-through functions, target=_blank] allow you to send arbitrary SQL to the data source, while passing in values to substitute from ThoughtSpot.

The basic form of the SQL Pass-through function is:

`sql_passthrough_function("<sql_statement>", <ThoughtSpot variable 1>, <ThoughtSpot variable 2>,...)`

The list of variables after are substituted into the SQL statement using curly braces in the order listed, starting at 0:

`sql_bool_op ( "tableName.columnName IN ({0}, {1})" , parameterName0, parameterName1)`

If you are referencing a field NOT in ThoughtSpot, perhaps a column that is not part of the JOINed data model or of a complex data type ThoughtSpot does not natively recognize, you need to qualify the column with `tableName.columnName` syntax in your query, so that the SQL is not ambiguous if a similar column name exists on multiple tables.

If you do not get all your data types correct, the ThoughtSpot-generated query will cause errors at the data warehouse level, which you will see in ThoughtSpot.

==== Set a Worksheet filter on the Worksheet security formula
The last step is to set a *Worksheet filter* on the *formula* you just created to evaluate the 'check parameter'.

Click the Add new icon (+) next to Filters, and choose the formula you created (at the end of the list):

[.bordered]
[.widthAuto]
image::./images/new_worksheet_filter_step_1.png[Create New Filter on Worksheet]

At the bottom of the filter dialog that appears, choose "Add values in bulk":
[.bordered]
[.widthAuto]
image::./images/new_worksheet_filter_step_2.png[Choose add values in bulk]

Type in the value *true* in the bulk dialog box, then press "Done":

[.bordered]
[.widthAuto]
image::./images/new_worksheet_filter_step_3.png[Type in true in bulk values box]

Once you click **Done** on the filter dialog, you should see it listed on the Edit Worksheet page:

== Indexing
Several features within ThoughtSpot, such as autocompletion in Search on values within columns or the suggestions in Explore, use ThoughtSpot indexing.

Due to the runtime nature of ABAC via tokens, ThoughtSpot indexing will not be restricted by the values supplied in a token.

You must turn off indexing for any field that needs to be restricted by RLS when using ABAC via tokens for RLS.

== Known limitations

* Schedules created with JWT using ABAC will not follow the same security rules as schedules created with standard RLS set up in ThoughtSpot. +
Schedules created by users in a session secured via RLS using ABAC currently do not follow any data security rules, that is, all data will be shown in schedules. ThoughtSpot recommends removing the ability to create schedules for your end users. The improvements in the upcoming versions include:
.. The security rules applied to the schedule will be those of the schedule creator
.. Using `persist:true` in the JWT for security rules will ensure that the schedule is run using the filter rules persisted on the user.
//* Runtime filter conditions must match the column names in your worksheet to avoid data leakage.

//+
//The `runtime_filters` must include the exact ThoughtSpot worksheet column name, or they will not apply to the data set. If a worksheet is changed, you must coordinate between the team that maintains it and the team that builds the token request service, or the filters will no longer be applied. For the same reasons, the end users of an embedded app cannot have edit access to any worksheet using ABAC RLS via tokens. +
+
Currently, the ABAC via tokens method requires using trusted authentication and using Worksheets as data sources for Liveboards and Answers, rather than individual Table objects.
You can pass in runtime filters and Parameters for a user via their login token. Both features work like the runtime filters and Parameters available within the Visual Embed SDK, but values set via token cannot be overridden by any user action within the ThoughtSpot UI.
