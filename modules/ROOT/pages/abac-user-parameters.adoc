:page-description: Attribute-based access control pattern can be achieved via user parameters sent in the login token

In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) implementation, security entitlements are sent in as lists of attributes at session creation time via the authentication service.

This article provides a detailed overview of the ABAC implementation via tokens for row-level security (RLS), and lists configuration recommendations, and best practices.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ABAC feature is disabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====


// * The `user_parameters` property in `auth/token/full` and `auth/token/object` APIs used for the beta implementation of ABAC is deprecated in 10.4.0.cl. 
// * Starting with 10.4.0.cl, security attributes for ABAC will not be stored in the `user` > `user_parameters` object. All ABAC-related security rules and filters applied via token generated using the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint are stored in the `user` > `access_control_properties` object.
// * The  +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">Custom access token </a>+++ REST API endpoint.


== Configuration recommendations and best practices

Before you begin, note the following recommendations and feature limitations:

Indexing::
Several features within ThoughtSpot, such as autocompletion in Search on values within columns or the suggestions in Explore mode, use ThoughtSpot indexing. Due to the runtime nature of ABAC via tokens, ThoughtSpot indexing will not be restricted by the values supplied in a token.
 +
You must turn off indexing for any field that needs to be restricted by RLS when using ABAC via tokens for RLS, or also include an RLS Rule on fields that must also be filtered for the Indexing system.

+
[NOTE]
====
ABAC rules are not supported on Liveboards with AI Highlights and Change Analysis features, and on the Answers generated from Spotter.
====

Mandatory token filters::
When setting filter rules within the token, you must place the `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` property on every column in a Worksheet or Model where a filter rule is expected. This will deny any access to data if a user has not been assigned values for the expected set of fields.

+
[NOTE]
====
On instances running 10.5.0.cl and 10.4.0.cl versions, if a column is set as hidden (`is_hidden: true`), the `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` setting will not be applied to the column. Due to this, the user may see no data. To work around this issue, we recommend upgrading your instance to 10.6.0.cl. On versions lower than 10.6.0.cl, ensure that you set the `is_hidden` parameter to `false` on the column before applying filter rules.
====

[#column-name-warning]
Column names in Worksheet/ Model::
The filter rules require passing the *exact* ThoughtSpot Worksheet or Model column name, or the values will not bind to any column. You must coordinate between the team that maintains the Worksheets or Models and the team that builds the xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] to know if any changes will be made to a Model or Worksheet. +
For the same reasons, the end users of an embedded app cannot have *edit* access to any Worksheet or Model using ABAC RLS via tokens. +
Setting the `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` property on every column where a filter rule is expected ensures that no data gets returned for users when column names change.

API for token generation::
The ABAC via tokens feature in ThoughtSpot 10.4.0.cl and later versions involves generating a token with filter rules and parameter values using the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">auth/token/custom</a>+++ API endpoint. Customers using the xref:abac-user-parameters-beta.adoc[beta version of ABAC with the V2.0 Get token APIs] (`auth/token/full` or `auth/token/object`) to `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`, refer to the instructions in the xref:jwt-migration.adoc[migration guide].


== ABAC attributes

Administrators can set the following attributes for a user via the authentication token, along with the capability to assign the user to ThoughtSpot groups:

* xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Filter rules] +
Can filter multiple values of any data type. Binds to any Column in any Model or Worksheet with a matching column name in ThoughtSpot (and not the underlying database table column name).

* xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[Parameter values] +
Binds a single value to any Parameter in any Worksheet or Model by Parameter Name and Type match. Parameters can be used in *Worksheet formulas* and then as *Worksheet filters*.

The request for a token with ABAC details can xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc#persistForUser[persist] the set of filters and Parameter values to user sessions within ThoughtSpot, after which all sessions and scheduled reports will use the persisted values until they are changed by another token generation request.

== Token request
The ABAC message to ThoughtSpot is encoded in JSON Web Token (JWT) format. This token can be used as a bearer token for Cookieless trusted authentication or REST API access. You can also use it as a sign-in token to create a session, in which case, we recommend that the ABAC user properties be  *persisted*, to ensure scheduled exports remain secure after the session ends.

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot compresses the size of the JWT token by default to ensure that larger payloads, for instance, more complex filtering conditions can be passed via JWT. ThoughtSpot recommends leaving that compression on to ensure all JWT tokens can get properly interpreted by the application regardless of their size, and to obfuscate the values passed in the JWT payload. However, if you want to decode the JWT token and decode the values of the token (at the expense of compression), contact ThoughtSpot Support.
====

=== Request format
// UPDATE THIS TO REFLECT THE CUSTOM ENDPOINT

The +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">Custom access token </a>+++ API provides the fields to define the various ABAC attributes within an access token request.

The following properties of the Custom Access Token request are used for ABAC:

* `persist_option`
* `filter_rules`
* `parameter_values`
* `objects`

The format for the objects in each section follows the equivalent formats in the Visual Embed SDK for xref:runtime-filters.adoc[runtime filters] and xref:runtime-parameters.adoc[runtime Parameters].

An example of setting both `filter_rules` and `parameter_values` without any persistence:

[source,JavaScript]
----
"persist_option": "NONE",
"filter_rules": [
   {
     "column_name": "Region",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["West", "Southwest"]
   },
   {
     "column_name": "Product Type",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["Shirts", "Swimwear"]
   }
 ],
 "parameter_values": [
   {
     "name": "Secured",
     "values": ["rxzricmwfe87q7bh7jyg"]
   }
 ]
----

[NOTE]
====
Passing an empty array in a filter column clears all filter rules and doesn't apply the filters on the column.
====

=== Apply to specific objects
By default, any specified filter or parameter will bind to any content with an exact match for the column or Parameter name.

You can choose the filter or Parameter to apply only to specific ThoughtSpot objects by including an `objects` array in the following format:

[source,JavaScript]
----
"objects": [
   {
     // example of the format
     "type": "{OBJECT_TYPE}",
     "identifier": "{id or name of the object}"
   },
   {
      "type": "LOGICAL_TABLE",
      "identifier": "9b751df2-d344-4850-9756-18535797378c"
   }
]
----

[NOTE]
====
The only supported object types for data security are logical tables.
====

[#persistForUser]
=== Token-based override versus persisting values
When using a `persist_option` other than `NONE`, the *filter_rules* and *parameter_values* defined in the token request using the `auth/token/custom` API endpoint are stored in the `user` > `access_control_properties` object.

Persisted values for a user are used by ThoughtSpot for any scheduled reports, as well as when no other token is provided.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When `persist_option` is set to `NONE`, it only acts as an *override*, with the values tied only to the specific token. The REST API token request with any values where `persist_option` is not `NONE` acts as an "update the user object" API endpoint even if you don't use the token generated from the API request.
* Note that the stored properties of the user are updated when the token request is successful, rather than at the first use of the token.
====

The `persist_option` has the following possible values :

[cols="1,1,2"]
[options='header']
|=====
|value|available version|behavior

|`NONE`
|10.4.0.cl and later
|User properties are not updated by the token request.

|`APPEND`
|10.4.0.cl and later
|New attributes in the token request are added to existing properties of the user object.

|`RESET`
|10.4.0.cl and later
|All persisted attributes on the user object are cleared. New attributes defined in the API request are still encoded in the token.

|`REPLACE`
|10.5.0.cl and later
a|All persisted rules and attributes of the user object are replaced with the set specified in the token request.

[NOTE]
====
* By default, the `RESET` option resets all attributes. In 10.6.0.cl and later versions, you can specify the attributes  to reset in the `reset_option` attribute. The `reset_option` allows resetting only filter rules, Parameters, or group properties in the token API request.
* In 10.4.0.cl, the `REPLACE` behavior can be achieved by making a `RESET` request followed by an `APPEND` request, then passing only the `APPEND` request token to the browser.
====
|=====

Filters and parameters must be *persisted* for them to apply to user sessions when using xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#cookie[cookie-based trusted authentication] or scheduled reports.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|=====
|persist|authentication type|behavior

|`NONE`
|Cookieless Trusted Authentication
|Attributes assigned to the token override the user's access control properties, without updating the user object.

|`NONE`
|Cookie-based Trusted Authentication
|Attributes assigned to the token will not be considered. The user logs in using a session cookie and  the properties from the previous session persist.

|`APPEND` or `REPLACE`
|Cookieless Trusted Authentication
|Attributes assigned to the token override the user's access control properties, but the user object is also updated

|`APPEND` or `REPLACE`
|Cookie-based Trusted Authentication
|Token request updates the user's access control properties and the token is used by the Visual Embed SDK to start a session.

|`APPEND` or `REPLACE`
|Discard token after request
|Token request updates the user object.
|=====

Persisting values opens up use cases for ABAC outside of the cookieless Trusted Authentication pattern: even if users authenticate via SAML, OIDC, or go directly into ThoughtSpot via username and password, an administrator can make a token request with a `persist_option` to write `filter_rules` and `parameter_values` to the user object.

=== Reset persisted values
To fully remove all persisted `filter_rules` or `parameter_values` from a user object, set `"persist_option" : "RESET"` in the token request.

The requested token can still be used for ABAC if you included `filter_rules` or `parameter_values` in the request.

=== Token request test page
A downloadable, customizable web page for testing all of the ABAC and trusted authentication capabilities is link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/ts_everywhere_resources/tree/master/examples/abac_with_token_auth[available on GitHub^]. 

The username specified in the test page must have Administrator privilege or you can supply the *secret_key* for the ThoughtSpot instance to request a token for any user along with setting their ABAC properties. 

See the xref:trusted-authentication.adoc[trusted authentication] documentation for full details on proper setup to allow trusted authentication.

== Filter rules for multi-value RLS
The ABAC via tokens pattern allows for setting arbitrary filters and overriding the values of existing Worksheet parameters. These two capabilities can be combined in various ways to create secure and unbreakable RLS.

=== Deny all by default
Starting in ThoughtSpot 10.4.0.cl, you can add `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` to the TML definition of any column in a Worksheet or Model.

ThoughtSpot checks to see if the logged-in user has any `filter_rules` defined for a column marked with `is_mandatory_filter: true`, and denies access to any data if a filter rule for the matching column is not found.

=== Show All 
The way to show all values for a column protected by `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` is to pass the special keyword `["TS_WILDCARD_ALL"]` as the value for the column in the `filter_rules`.

Columns without `is_mandatory_token_filter: true` will show all values if there is no `filter_rule` for that column.

=== Build the ABAC token request
The xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] must have the following to build a token request for ABAC:

1. Filter rules for defining multi-value conditions on columns
2. Parameter values for use in Worksheet or Model formulas

The filter rules must be built by:

1. Retrieving user data entitlements
2. Translating entitlements into ThoughSpot `filter_rules`

==== Retrieve entitlements
The value of the ABAC pattern is that you can send different combinations of filters for different types of users.

You can retrieve the attribute names and values from any source: the embedding application's session details, an entitlement REST API, a query to a different database, etc.

==== Translate entitlements into filter rules

Filter rules *match on the name property of a column* as defined in ThoughtSpot, not the column's name in the underlying database table. 

The xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] *MUST* know the ThoughtSpot column names that will be used for each of the attributes, so you'll need to coordinate between ThoughtSpot Worksheet designers and the xref:trusted-auth-token-request-service.adoc[token request service] to make sure the matching column names and values are being sent.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[#dev-deploy-warning]
End users of an embedded app cannot have *edit* access to any Worksheet using ABAC RLS via tokens.

You must follow xref:development-and-deployment.adoc[proper development and deployment practices] for all your customer-facing production environments as well as the production token request service.
====

As mentioned in the preceding section, the format for filter rules within the token matches with xref:runtime-filters.adoc[runtime filters] in the Visual Embed SDK. In general, RLS entitlements are lists of values using the `IN` operator, but you can pass in filters on numeric and time columns using the full set of operators.

All values are passed into the token as *arrays of strings*, even if the column is a numeric, boolean, or date type in ThoughtSpot and the database. The column data type will be respected in the query issued to the database.

For example, let's assume three attributes that are needed to filter down a user on a multi-tenanted database: `Customer ID`, `Region`, and `Product Type`.

The following is what the token request would look like if restricting on all three attributes:

[source,JavaScript]
----
"filter_rules": [
   {
     "column_name" : "Customer ID",
     "operator": "EQ",
     "values": ["492810"]
  },
   {
     "column_name": "Region",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["West", "Southwest"]
   },
   {
     "column_name": "Product Type",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["Shirts", "Swimwear"]
   }
 ]
----

A user might be entitled to *all access* on any given column (you might drop some levels of a hierarchy if you include more granular columns to filter on for that user).

The following is a request where a different user can see all `Region`, but still has restrictions on `Customer ID` and `Product Type`, using the `TS_WILDCARD_ALL` value to allow data even when the column expects a filter from the token:

[source,javascript]
----
"filter_rules": [
   { 
     "column_name" : "Customer ID",
     "operator": "EQ",
     "values": ["TS_WILDCARD_ALL"]
   },
   {
     "column_name" : "Customer ID",
     "operator": "EQ",
     "values": ["492810"],
  },
   {
     "column_name": "Product Type",
     "operator": "IN",
     "values": ["Shirts", "Swimwear"],
   }
 ]
----

Because the `filter_rules` section is entirely within the control of the *token request service*, you have full flexibility to generate any set of filters for any type of user within the token.

== Parameters to filter via formulas
The basic pattern for using a Parameter to filter a Worksheet or Model includes these steps:

. Create link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/parameters-create[Parameters, window=_blank] in Worksheet
. Make link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/formulas[formula, window=_blank] that evaluates the Parameter's default value and the expected values from the token
. Make link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/filters#_worksheet_filters[Worksheet filter, window=_blank] based on the formula, set to `true`.

link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/parameters-create[Parameters, target=_blank] are defined at the Worksheet level within ThoughtSpot. Parameters have a data type and a default value set by the Worksheet author.

You can also add `is_hidden: true` to a Parameter definition using TML, which allows the flexibility to use as many parameters as desired for any type of formula to be used as a Worksheet filter, without cluttering the visible UI.

To use a Parameter, you'll create a link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/formulas[formula, window=_blank] on the Worksheet or Model. link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/filters#_worksheet_filters[Worksheet filters, window=_blank] can reference Worksheet formulas once they have been created, which creates the security layer out of the result derived from the formula.

All of these Worksheet-level features are set by clicking *Edit* on the Worksheet, then expanding the menu on the left sidebar:

[.bordered]
[.widthAuto]
image:./images/worksheet_edit_sidebar.png[Worksheet Edit Sidebar]

==== Create the Worksheet security formula
A Parameter doesn't do anything on its own. You need a formula to evaluate the Parameter's value.

Any security formula to be used on a Worksheet should result in a *boolean* true or false, and then the Worksheet filter will be set to only return data when the formula returns true.

===== Logic for groups to see all data
In any security formula you build, you may want a clause that gives access to all data to certain groups.

You can chain together any number of `if...then...else` clauses within a formula, including using the `ts_groups` or `ts_username` values, to build out your preferred logic:

`if ( 'data developers' in ts_groups ) then true else if ( parameter_name = field_name ) then true else false`

===== Formulas comparing a parameter to a column
Parameters can be used in a formula to directly match a value in a column, or any other type of function you'd like to use:

`if ( parameter_name = field_name ) then true else false`

[#worksheet-filter]
==== Set a Worksheet filter on the Worksheet security formula
The last step is to set a *Worksheet filter* on the *formula* you just created to evaluate the 'check parameter'.

. Click the Add new icon (+) next to *Filters*. +
. Click the formula you created (at the end of the list) in the *Filter* dialog.
+

. Click **Done** on the Filter dialog. +
You should see it listed on the *Edit Worksheet* page:

==== Use Parameters with pass-through functions
link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/formula-reference#passthrough-functions[ThoughtSpot SQL Pass-through functions, window=_blank] allow you to send arbitrary SQL to the data source, while passing in values to substitute from ThoughtSpot.

The basic form of the SQL Pass-through function is:

`sql_passthrough_function("<sql_statement>", <ThoughtSpot variable 1>, <ThoughtSpot variable 2>,...)`

The proper pass-through function to use in most cases is `sql_bool_op`, which can be used in a filter set to `true` as xref:#worksheet-filter[shown above]. 

The list of variables after are substituted into the SQL statement using curly braces in the order listed, starting at 0:

`sql_bool_op ( "tableName.columnName IN ({0}, {1})" , parameterName0, parameterName1)`

If you do not get all your data types correct, the ThoughtSpot-generated query will cause errors at the data warehouse level, which you will see in ThoughtSpot.

===== Fully-qualify all column references
If you are using a column that is part of the current ThoughtSpot Worksheet, you can simply reference that column using the substitution syntax of the pass-through functions:

`sql_bool_op ( "{0} IN ({1}, {2})" , columnInWorksheet, parameterName0, parameterName1)`

If you are referencing a field NOT in ThoughtSpot, perhaps a column that is not part of the JOINed data model or of a complex data type ThoughtSpot does not natively recognize, you need to *fully-qualify the column name* with at minimum `tableName.columnName` syntax in your query, so that the SQL is not ambiguous if a similar column name exists on multiple tables.

You may need a full `database.schema.tableName.columnName` syntax, in the standard syntax of the particular data warehouse being used, for the SQL to work within the rest of the ThoughtSpot-generated query.

===== Sub-queries to solve multi-step filtering scenarios
Many reporting solutions require very complex logic to establish a user's data entitlements.

Traditionally, this can be solved by either writing dynamically generated SQL queries into an application or by placing the logic within a database in a way that the results of the logic can be referenced easily by other SQL queries. This may involve stored procedures, user-defined functions, temporary tables or any of the many other tools provided by a given RDBMS.

ThoughtSpot does not allow for the writing of *arbitrary dynamic SQL*. Pass-through functions must be written and remain the same for all users, with *ThoughtSpot Parameters* being the only aspect that can be changed dynamically.

Writing a *sub-query* as a pass-through function, with a parameter whose value is provided securely via ABAC, provides a method for accessing any number of tables or features within your data warehouse, while guaranteeing the filter will be applied to all searches made using the ThoughtSpot Worksheet.

The basic form of the sub-query formula is:

`sql_bool_op('{0} IN (SELECT DatabaseField FROM FullyQualifiedTable WHERE OtherField = {1})', WorksheetField , Param)`

The SQL when expanded out looks like:

[,sql]
----
ws.FieldNameAlias IN (
   SELECT DatabaseField
   FROM FullyQualifiedTable
   WHERE OtherField = '{ParameterValue}'
)
----

You could similarly call a UDF or stored procedure that returns a column of the same type as the WorksheetField:

`sql_bool_op('{0} IN (udf_function_name({1}))', WorksheetField , Param)`

The overall pattern is to use the Parameter value, sent in via ABAC, to retrieve a specific set of values set within the database, using whatever techniques are available.

An example workflow might be:

1. User logs into embedding application.
2. A stored procedure is called in the database to grab their latest entitlements and store those in a table, with a single "entitlement_session_id" returned to the application.
3. The "entitlement_session_id" is sent as an ABAC parameter as part of the ThoughtSpot token request for the user.
4. Worksheets that need these entitlements use the combination of pass-through function with parameter + formula + filter so that all queries in ThoughtSpot include a WHERE clause with the sub-select.

== Known limitations
The ABAC via tokens method requires using trusted authentication and using Worksheets or Models as data sources for Liveboards and Answers, rather than individual Table objects.

For indexing recommendations, see xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc#_configuration_recommendations_and_best_practices[Configuration recommendations and best practices].

////
* Several features within ThoughtSpot, such as autocompletion in Search on values within columns or the suggestions in *Explore* mode, use ThoughtSpot indexing. Due to the runtime nature of ABAC via tokens, ThoughtSpot indexing will not be restricted by the values supplied in a token.
+ 
You must turn off indexing for any field that needs to be restricted by RLS when using ABAC via tokens for RLS, or also include an RLS Rule on fields that must also be filtered for the Indexing system.


// * Schedules created with JWT using ABAC will not follow the same security rules as schedules created with standard RLS set up in ThoughtSpot. +
// Schedules created by users in a session secured via RLS using ABAC currently do not follow any data security rules, that is, all data will be shown in schedules. ThoughtSpot recommends removing the ability to create schedules for your end users. The improvements in the upcoming versions include:

// .. Using `persist:true` in the JWT for security rules will ensure that the schedule is run using the filter rules persisted on the user.
//* Runtime filter conditions must match the column names in your worksheet to avoid data leakage.

//The `runtime_filters` must include the exact ThoughtSpot worksheet column name, or they will not apply to the data set.

// +

// You can pass in runtime filters and Parameters for a user via their login token. Both features work like the runtime filters and Parameters available within the Visual Embed SDK, but values set via token cannot be overridden by any user action within the ThoughtSpot UI.
