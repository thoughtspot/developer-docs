:page-title: Using REST API v2.0 metadata/search endpoint
:page-pageid: rest-apiv2-metadata-search
:page-description: Many use cases are possible with the very V2.0 metadata/search endpoint

The `link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fmetadata%2Fsearch-metadata[/metadata/search, target=_blank]` endpoint is the most versatile of all metadata endpoints. It can be used to search for lists or to retrieve very detailed information about specific objects. This endpoint replaces `metadata/list`, `metadata/listobjectheaders`, `metadata/details`, and `metadata/listvizheaders` from REST API v1.

The overall structure of `metadata/search` request is link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fmodels%2Fstructures%2Fapi-rest-20-metadata-search-request[described as a combination of objects, target=_blank].

Note that many parameters in the request are *optional*, and leaving the parameter name out entirely has a different effect from including the parameter and specific values.

Throughout this article, requests and responses will be shown as JSON, without any of the code to send the requests. The V2.0 Playground generates requests that always include the default values for any parameters that have them, but this article excludes them. Assume every request you see has the following parameters in addition to what is shown:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "record_offset" : 0,
  "record_size": 10,
}
----

If you are not using filtering options such as `tag_identifiers`, `type`, `created_by_user_identifiers`, `modified_by_user_identifiers`, `owned_by_user_identifiers`, `exclude_objects`, `include_auto_created_objects`, or `favorite_object_options`, set `record_size` to `-1` and `record_offset` to `0` for precise results.

== Response format
The response from any call to `metadata/search` will resemble the following:

[source,JSON]
----
[
  {
  "metadata_id": "4081f38c-1f26-4354-a418-af14136e3bd7",
  "metadata_name": "Snowflake",
  "metadata_type": "LIVEBOARD",
  "dependent_objects": null,
  "incomplete_objects": null,
  "metadata_detail": null,
  "metadata_header": {...},
  "visualization_headers": null,
  "stats": null,
  },
...
]
----

The value of `metadata_header` is a complex object with the most important set of attributes of the item. Note that `author` is the creator or current user who has been assigned the __ownership__ of the object, while `owner` describes a hierarchical relationship between ThoughtSpot objects (for example, this Liveboard has an `owner` property identical to its own `id` property):

[source,JSON]
----
"metadata_header": {
      "hasTabs": false,
      "modelVersion": "V1",
      "hasMandatoryFilter": false,
      "isMandatoryFilterValueSelected": true,
      "totalContainerCount": 36,
      "id": "2681a4d3-98ad-4d37-b5c0-378dbac36320",
      "indexVersion": 14,
      "generationNum": 48857,
      "name": "Snowflake",
      "description": "Connection to Snowflake data warehouse",
      "author": "67e15c06-d153-4924-a4cd-ff615393b60f",
      "authorName": "UserA,
      "hasLenientDiscoverability": false,
      "descriptionAutoGenerated": false,
      "authorDisplayName": "UserA",
      "created": 1592450556601,
      "modified": 1592605750424,
      "modifiedBy": "67e15c06-d153-4924-a4cd-ff615393b60f",
      "owner": "2681a4d3-98ad-4d37-b5c0-378dbac36320",
      "isDeleted": false,
      "isHidden": false,
      "isAutoCreated": false,
      "isAutoDelete": false,
      "resolvedObjects": {},
      "tags": [],
      "aiAnswerGenerationDisabled": false,
      "isExternal": false,
      "isDeprecated": false,
      "isSharedViaConnection": false
 }
----

You'll notice a number of other keys with a `null` value. Various request parameters cause those sections of the response to be filled in with additional details.

== Lists of metadata
The `/metadata/search` API performs listing functions when you do not send specific object IDs as part of your request.

The basic metadata selectors are placed in the `metadata` parameter as an array of link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fmodels%2Fstructures%2Fmetadata-list-item-input[Metadata List objects, target=_blank].

For example, to get all Liveboards, you need to send only a single metadata object with `type` parameter set to  `LIVEBOARD`.

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ]
{
----

[NOTE]
====
The `type` attribute is set to `LIVEBOARD` by default. In other words, even if the `type` attribute is not defined and the API request is sent with an empty body, ThoughtSpot returns only Liveboard objects.
====

To match names against a pattern, you can use the `name_pattern` parameter, including `%` for wildcard purposes:


[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD",
      "name_pattern": "Standard %"
    }
  ]
}
----
You may still want to process the result set further within your programming language.

== Retrieve specific objects
The `identifier` parameter allows referencing an object by name or by object GUID.

Specific objects can be retrieved via the object GUID without specifying `type`:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "identifier": "009d8d6c-5026-47a9-96d7-9e0f84896d17"
    }
  ]
}
----

You can specify an object name in the `identifier` key, but you must include the `type` in this request:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD",
      "identifier": "My Great Liveboard"
    }
  ]
}
----

The response to a `metadata/search` request takes the form of an array of link:https://try-everywhere.thoughtspot.cloud/v2/#/everywhere/api/rest/playgroundV2_0?apiResourceId=http%2Fmodels%2Fstructures%2Fmetadata-search-response[Metadata Response Objects, target=_blank]:

[source,JSON]
----
"[
  {
    "metadata_id": "009d8d6c-5026-47a9-96d7-9e0f84896d17"
    "metadata_name": "New Liveboard"
    "metadata_type": "LIVEBOARD"
    "dependent_objects": null
    "incomplete_objects": null
    "metadata_detail": null
    "metadata_header": {...}
    "visualization_headers": null
    "stats": null
  },
  ...
]
----

The `metadata_header` key is always returned with values, regardless of the request. This section resembles the V1 REST API response from the xref:metadata-api.adoc#metadata-list[`metadata/list`] and xref:metadata-api.adoc#object-header[`metadata/listobjectheaders`] endpoints.

== Filtering and sorting

=== sort_options
The `sort_options` parameter requires link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fmodels%2Fstructures%2Fmetadata-search-sort-options[Metadata Search Sort Options, target=_blank] to sort on one field of the metadata response either in the ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
 "include_visualization_headers": true,
 "sort_options" : {
  "field_name": "LAST_ACCESSED",
  "order": "ASC"
 }
}
----

If you need multiple levels of sorting, you'll have to parse the response programmatically and apply a sorting algorithm on the properties within each response item.

=== permissions
You can filter responses based on who can access the object, that is, who the content has been shared to, using the `permissions` parameter.

While the `permissions` parameter filters the response set of `metadata/search`, the objects in the response do not list the full set of assigned permissions. Please use the `link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fsecurity%2Ffetch-permissions-on-metadata[/security/metadata/fetch-permissions/`, target=_blank]` endpoint for a full listing, which replaces the individual `security` endpoints in the v1 REST API, such as the xref:security-api.adoc#obj-permission-all[get object permission details for a specific object type] endpoint.

The `permissions` object takes an array of objects that define a `principal` and a `link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fmodels%2Fenumerations%2Fshare-mode[share_mode, target=_blank]`. `principal` is an object with a `type` of `USER` or `USER_GROUP` and an `identifier`, either the name or the GUID of the principal:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
 "permissions" : [
    {
      "principal": {
        "type": "USER_GROUP",
        "identifier": "Administrators"
      },
      "share_mode": "MODIFY"
    }
  ]
}
----

The `share_mode` can be `READ_ONLY` ('Can View' in the UI), `MODIFY` ('Can Edit' in the UI), or `NO_ACCESS`, which shows denial of access and is not visible in the UI.

=== tag_identifiers
Thoughtspot objects can be assigned multiple **tags**, and the `/metadata/search` endpoint allows you to filter for items with a set of tags using the `tag_identifiers` parameter, which takes an array of tag names or GUIDs.

Including multiple tags behaves as a logical **OR** operation, retrieving all content with **any** of the listed tags. The following request body retrieves any content tagged with `Staging` or `Accounting` tags:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
"tag_identifiers": [
  'Staging',
  'Accounting'
 ]
}
----

=== created_by_user_identifiers and modified_by_user_identifiers
The `created_by_user_identifiers` and `modified_by_user_identifiers` parameters take a list of user names or GUIDs, and filter the results to only those with objects that were created by or modified by those users.

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
"created_by_user_identifiers": [
  'bryant.howell',
  'bill.back'
 ]
}
----

=== favorite_object_options
The `favorite_object_options` parameter takes an object that filters the result list to only objects that are added as favorites.

To retrieve the favorites list for the user making the request, set the `include` property to `true`:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
"favorite_object_options": {
  "include": true
 }
}
----

A user with administrator privileges can request on behalf of other users by specifying the user name or GUID in the `user_identifiers` array. If you send multiple user identifiers, the result includes a full set of all objects set as favorites for all listed users, with no particular way to identify who favorited which content.

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ],
"favorite_object_options": {
  "include": true,
  "user_identifiers": ['bill.back']
 }
}
----

=== exclude_objects
The `exclude_objects` parameter takes an array of objects that can exclude items from the returned list:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LOGICAL_TABLE"
    }
  ],
 "exclude_objects": [
    {
      "identifier": "Retail Sales",
      "type": "LOGICAL_TABLE"
    }
 ]
}
----

== Additional response details
There are a number of parameters that add new data to the response, allowing the `metadata/search` endpoint to answer questions that require multiple API calls in the v1 REST API.

=== include_visualization_headers
The v1 REST API endpoint xref:metadata-api.adoc#viz-header[`metadata/listvizheaders`] retrieves the header details of all individual visualizations on a Liveboard.

In v2, the `include_visualization_headers` parameter adds the visualization headers to the response.

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "identifier": "009d8d6c-5026-47a9-96d7-9e0f84896d17"
    }
  ],
 "include_visualization_headers": true
}
----

Note from above that the response to **every** request has the `visualization_headers` key, but the value will be `null` unless `include_visualization_headers` is `true`, and the object type is `LIVEBOARD`.

The `include_visualization_headers` adds the array of visualization headers for every element in the response, so you can request a list of all Liveboards and all the visualizations on those Liveboards all at once.

=== include_details
The v1 REST API has an endpoint called `metadata/details` for retrieving a very large and complex object containing as much detail as possible about the requested object and its relationships with other objects within ThoughtSpot.

The `include_details` parameter in the `metadata/search` API request adds the equivalent details object to each element retrieved by `metadata/search` to the response under the `metadata_detail` key.

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "identifier": "009d8d6c-5026-47a9-96d7-9e0f84896d17"
    }
  ],
 "include_details": true
}
----

The details of each object type is a complex object that is unique to each object type within ThoughtSpot.

=== include_dependent_objects
Data objects in Thoughtspot like Tables and Worksheets have **dependent objects** that connect to them. Liveboards and Answers do not have dependent objects, they can only be a dependent object.

An object can only be deleted if all of its dependent objects are deleted first.

The v1 REST API had an entire set of xref:dependent-objects-api.adoc[dependent objects APIs] for retrieving these relationships.

The equivalent information is retrieved from `metadata/search` by setting the `include_dependent_objects` parameter to `true`:

[source,JSON]
----
{
 "metadata": [
    {
      "identifier": "782b50d1-fe89-4fee-812f-b5f9eb0a552d"
    }
  ],
 "include_dependent_objects": true
}
----

The response will now have an object for the `dependent_objects` key. This object is of a complex format, that always starts with a key that is the metadata object's own GUID, with the value being an object with keys of the various internal object type identifiers (note "LOGICAL_TABLE" and "QUESTION_ANSWER_BOOK" in the response below):

[source,JSON]
----
"dependent_objects":{
  "782b50d1-fe89-4fee-812f-b5f9eb0a552d":{
      "LOGICAL_TABLE": [...]
      "QUESTION_ANSWER_BOOK": [...]
  }
}
----
The array for each object type will contain the metadata headers for the various dependent objects, including the GUIDs necessary to do any further actions on those dependent objects as the `id` property.

Common use cases for the dependent objects include tagging, auditing proper sharing, proper deletion, and any other tasks for applying a change in bulk to related objects in one data model.

=== include_stats
The `include_stats` boolean option causes the `stats` key of the response to be filled with an object with statistics about user access to the object.

=== include_worksheet_search_assist_data
The `include_worksheet_search_assist_data` boolean parameter includes details about the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/search-assist[Search Assist, target=_blank] feature within the response.

=== include_hidden_objects, include_incomplete_objects, include_auto_created_objects
The `metadata/search` response typically excludes objects that are `auto-created`, `hidden`, or `incomplete`, as these objects represent internal use cases typically not seen or modified by any end user.

The `include_hidden_objects`, `include_incomplete_objects`, and `include_auto_created_objects` boolean parameters can be used if you have a known use-case where you need metadata information from an object marked under one of these categories (for example, the internal hidden answer objects that represent each visualization on a Liveboard).
