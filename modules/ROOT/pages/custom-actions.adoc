:page-description: You can add custom buttons or menu items to the ThoughtSpot UI to let your application users to analyze insights and trigger an action on the data.

ThoughtSpot provides a set of standard menu commands and buttons, controlled via xref:embed-actions.adoc[actions].

Custom actions define a new menu item in one of: 

* the primary menu bar
* the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]
* the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or visualization

The link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent#_vizpointclick[VizPointClick HostEvent] behaves similar to a context menu custom action, but fires immediately on a click rather than from the right-click context menu.

Custom actions are implemented in two parts:

* *Within ThoughtSpot*, define the new menu item and where and when it will appear 
* *In the embedding app*, build code to receive the event and data when the menu item is clicked

== Define custom actions in ThoughtSpot
Custom actions] are xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[must be defined] within ThoughtSpot in the Develop tab. 

After a custom action has been created, there are number of options for assigning how and where the custom action will appear:

* xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Assign custom actions to an answer or a visualization on a Liveboard]
* xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[Assign custom actions to a worksheet]
* xref:custom-actions-edit.adoc[Set the menu position of a custom action]

== Ways for embedding app to receive custom actions
* *xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[Callback actions]*: Pass data and metadata from ThoughtSpot to the embedding page as an event
* *xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[URL actions]*: POST data directly to a specific web page or API endpoint destination
