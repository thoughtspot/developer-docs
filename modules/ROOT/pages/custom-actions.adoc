:page-title: Custom actions overview
:page-pageid: custom-action-intro
:page-description: You can add custom buttons or menu items to the ThoughtSpot UI to let your application users to analyze insights and trigger an action on the data.

ThoughtSpot provides a set of standard menu commands and buttons, controlled via xref:embed-actions.adoc[actions].

Custom actions add a new menu item to one of the following UI elements:

* the primary menu bar
* the **More** options menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]
* the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or visualization +

Custom actions in ThoughtSpot can be implemented in two different ways:

* Custom actions through the UI
* Custom actions done programmatically (code based)


////
Custom actions are implemented in two parts:

* *Within ThoughtSpot*, define the new menu item and its placement
* *In the embedding app*, build code to receive the event and data when the user clicks the menu action.

== Custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI
You must xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[create custom actions] in the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Custom actions** page of the ThoughtSpot UI.

After a custom action has been created, there are several options for assigning how and where the custom action will appear:

* xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Assign custom actions to an answer or a visualization on a Liveboard]
* xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[Assign custom actions to a Model]
* xref:custom-actions-edit.adoc[Set the menu position of a custom action]

== Code based custom actions
Code-based custom actions are custom menu items that you define within the application's code through the Visual Embed SDK.

These custom actions add a new menu item to one of the following UI elements in an Answer, Liveboard, visualization, or in the Spotter interface:

* the primary menu bar (except for Spotter)
* the **More** options menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]
* the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or visualization (not for Liveboard)

For more information, see xref:code-based-custom-actions.adoc[Code based custom actions].

== Ways for embedding apps to receive custom actions
* xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[Callback actions] +
Pass data and metadata from ThoughtSpot to the embedding page as an event. +
Can be done through the ThoughtSpot UI or in the code through ThoughtSpot's Visual Embed SDK.
* xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[URL actions] +
POST data directly to a specific web page or API endpoint destination. +
Only available through the ThoughtSpot UI.
