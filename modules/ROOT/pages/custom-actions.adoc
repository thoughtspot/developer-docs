:page-description: You can add custom buttons or menu items to the ThoughtSpot UI to let your application users to analyze insights and trigger an action on the data.

ThoughtSpot provides a set of standard menu commands and buttons, controlled via xref:embed-actions.adoc[actions].

Custom actions add a new menu item to one of the following UI elements in an Answer or Liveboard visualization:

* the primary menu bar
* the **More** options menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]
* the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or visualization +

====
The link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent#_vizpointclick[VizPointClick HostEvent] behaves in the same way as a context menu custom action, but fires immediately on a click rather than from the right-click context menu.

Custom actions are implemented in two parts:

* *Within ThoughtSpot*, define the new menu item and its placement
* *In the embedding app*, build code to receive the event and data when the user clicks the menu action.

== Define custom actions in ThoughtSpot
You must xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[create custom actions] in the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Custom actions** page of the ThoughtSpot UI.

After a custom action has been created, there are several options for assigning how and where the custom action will appear:

* xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Assign custom actions to an answer or a visualization on a Liveboard]
* xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[Assign custom actions to a worksheet]
* xref:custom-actions-edit.adoc[Set the menu position of a custom action]

== Ways for embedding apps to receive custom actions
* xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[Callback actions] +

* xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[URL actions] +
