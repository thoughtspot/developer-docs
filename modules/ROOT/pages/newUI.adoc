This page lists new features, enhancements, and deprecated functionality in ThoughtSpot full application embedded instances.

== Redesigned home page
[NOTE]

With the new home page, the top navigation has now been replaced with a left-hand navigation.

You can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions through the options in the left-hand navigation.
The new global navigation organizes ThoughtSpot into different contextual sections called apps. Each one is designed for a common type of ThoughtSpot user. Within each app, there is left-hand navigation specific to that app. You navigate to each app using the app switcher image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu].

== New persona-based navigation
Full app embedding now allows navigation organized by persona. The new app switcher image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] allows developers to work in a separate contextual section designed specifically for their needs. In addition, each app has left-hand navigation to create better consistency.

This new home page experience is disabled by default. Contact your ThoughtSpot administrator to enable this feature for your cluster. After that, open your user profile, and in the *Experience* section, set the *Navigation and Homepage* to *New experience*.
Note that this setting also enables the redesigned home page.////
