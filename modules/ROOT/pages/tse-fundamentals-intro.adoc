Welcome to TSE step-by-step, an introduction to ThoughtSpot Embedding. This is a self-guided course
content. Each section is broken down into a concrete topic along with instructions on the steps to follow and code
examples to let you work on the steps yourself.

== Requirements

This course was created using version 9.10.0.cl. Features are regularly updated, so if you are using a more recent
version, then things may have changed. Please provide feedback in the discussion or issues. You should be on a more
recent version of ThoughtSpot for some features.

* Access to ThoughtSpot with TSE enabled. If you don't have an account, you can create a link:https://thoughtspot.com/trial?tsref=dev=stepbystep[trial account].
* A code editor for editing the Javascript code. The examples will
use link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code], a free editor that works on many operating systems.
* A web server that will host static web content (.html, .css, .js files). The examples will use the Live Server plug-in for Visual Studio Code.
* A basic understanding of ThoughtSpot. This can be obtained by taking introductory courses. See
