:page-description: Get started with REST API v2.0 to access, create, and manage ThoughtSpot resources programmatically.

Before you get started with REST API v2.0, visit the REST API v2.0 Playground to view the endpoints and try out the API requests.

== Visit the API Playground

To access the REST API v2.0 Playground, go to **Develop** > **REST API** > **REST Playground v2.0**.

The Playground allows you to make API calls, view the request and response workflows, and create and download code samples.

== Set up your environment

By default, your cluster URL is set as the base path for your API requests.

* To allow a REST client to log in to ThoughtSpot using `username` and `password`, create a local user account in ThoughtSpot.
* To use OAuth 2.0 authentication method, make sure your ThoughtSpot instance has the required configuration to support the OpenID Provider or IdP that authenticates your users.
* To trusted authentication to authenticate REST clients, make sure xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[Trusted authentication is enabled] on your ThoughtSpot instance, and your authenticator service has access to the `secret key`.

== Authorize your client

To provide secure access to ThoughtSpot resources, the REST API v2.0 framework supports token-based authentication method. However, for local development or testing purposes, you can use basic authentication with `userName` and `password`.

To get a token that provides access to ThoughtSpot resources, you can send a `POST` request to one of the following API endpoints:

* `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object`
+
Provides a token to access a specific metadata object such as a Liveboard or saved Answer.

* `api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full`
+
Provides full access to ThoughtSpot.

For example, to get a bearer token that grants full access to ThoughtSpot application, send the following attributes in the request body:

.cURL
[sourc,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "username": "tsUserA",
  "password": "Guest@123!"
  "validity_time_in_sec": 86400
}'
----

If the API request is successful, the server returns the access token in the response body.

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "token": "{access-token}",
  "creation_time_in_millis": 1675129264089,
  "expiration_time_in_millis": 1675129564089,
  "scope": {
    "access_type": "FULL",
    "org_id": 1,
    "metadata_id": null
  },
  "valid_for_user_id": "59481331-ee53-42be-a548-bd87be6ddd4a",
  "valid_for_username": "tsUserA"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
By default, the bearer token is valid for 300 seconds. You can configure the token expiry duration as per your requirement or request a new token for your API sessions. If you send an API request with an expired token, the server returns an error.
====

== Log in to ThoughtSpot

To log in to ThoughtSpot, send a `POST` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/login` API endpoint. In your API request, you can either specify your `username` and `password` or use your bearer token in the authorization header.

After a successful login, a session cookie is set for your subsequent API calls. REST clients accessing APIs in a non-browser environment must set session cookies in the request header when making an API call.

== Make a test API call

To make a test API call, send an API request to an API endpoint. For example, to get a list of Liveboard objects, send the following request:

[source,cURL]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-host}/api/rest/2.0/metadata/search' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "LIVEBOARD"
    }
  ]
}'
----

=== Request headers

Each API call must include the following headers.

* `'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'`
+
The authorization header must include the OAuth token obtained from ThoughtSpot.

* `'Content-Type: application/json'`
+
The header to indicate the content type for the request body.

* `'Accept: application/json'`
+
The `Accept` header for API response format. 

////
* `X-Requested-By` __Optional__
+
The `'X-Requested-By: ThoughtSpot'` header in API requests to ThoughtSpot REST endpoints. 
////
* `User-Agent`
+
The `User-Agent` header is required for all requests.  Most clients will add the `User-Agent` header automatically. However, when making API calls from code, especially `.NET`, you must add the `User-Agent` header. 

+
The `User-Agent` can be any string; for example, you can set the header as `'User-Agent: <browser>/<browser-version><os/platform>'`.

=== Request body

The API calls require you to specify the GUID or name of the object as an identifier. For example, to get details of a user object, you can specify either the GUID or name of the user.

The API Playground indicates the required and optional parameters and provides information about the data type and allowed values. For example, to get a list of answers, you must specify the metadata `type` as `Answer`.

The following example shows the cURL request format to get a list of answers saved in the ThoughtSpot system.

[source,curl]
----
curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://{ThoughtSpot-host}/api/rest/2.0/metadata/search' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'\
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "ANSWER"
    }
  ]
}
----

=== API response

A successful API call returns a response body or the 204 response code. The REST API v2.0 framework supports standard HTTP response codes to indicate the status of a request.

* *200*
+
Indicates a successful operation. The API returns a response body.
* *204*
+
Indicates a successful operation. The 204 response does not include a response body.
* *400*
+
Indicates a bad request. You may have to modify the request before making another call.
* *401*
+
Indicates an unauthorized request. Check if you have the required credentials and object access to send the API request.

* *403*
+
Indicates forbidden access. Check your access privileges and user account status.

* *415*
+
Indicates an unsupported media type. Check the media type specified in the `Content-Type` header.

* *500*
+
Indicates an internal server error. Check if the data format of the request is supported. Verify if the server is available and can process the request.

If an API call returns an error in the Playground, you can view the error details by navigating to *root* > *error* > *message* > *debug* in the error response body.

== Example libraries
The link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_rest_api_v1_python[thoughtspot_rest_api_v1 Python library, window=_blank] includes a `TSRestApiV2` class that implements the v2.0 REST API. You can use this as a ready-made implementation for testing back-end REST API calls or as a pattern for implementing your own library in any other programming language.
