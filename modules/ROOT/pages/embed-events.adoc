:page-description: Events allow the embedding application to send and receive messages from embedded ThoughtSpot components.

ThoughtSpot supports a range of events that your app can listen to and respond to with appropriate actions. The embedded ThoughtSpot components emit events when they initialize and load, and when a user executes an action inside these components. The host application can also trigger events within the embedded ThoughtSpot objects, causing an alert or other action.

The SDK library includes the following event objects:

* xref:embed-events.adoc#embed-events[`EmbedEvent`]
* xref:embed-events.adoc#host-events[`HostEvent`]

[#embed-events]
== Embed events
Developers can register event listeners to listen to application actions such as component loading or user interactions with the embedded component and fire events. Embed events are emitted by the embedded ThoughtSpot components and are part of the `EmbedEvent` object.

=== Register event listeners

To register event listeners, import the `EmbedEvent` library into your application setup.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
  //...
  EmbedEvent
} from "@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk";
----

When you register an event listener, you can choose to log it in the console output or add a callback function to xref:embed-events.adoc#_handle_event_response_for_embedded_components[handle the event response] in the `.on(embedEvent, eventHandlerCallbackFunction)` format.

In the following example, the `EmbedEvent.Edit` is emitted and logged in the console output when a user clicks the *Edit* button on the embedded Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Edit, payload => {
   console.log(`Liveboard edit', payload);
})
----

=== Start and end specification

For some actions and events, you can register listeners to emit events when an action starts and ends. In this example, the `EmbedEvent.DownloadAsPdf` is emitted when the `DownloadAsPdf` starts and after the download is completed:

[source,JavaScript]
----
 //emit when the download workflow starts
 liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.DownloadAsPdf, payload => {
     console.log('download PDF', payload)
 }, {
     start: true
 })
 //emit when the download workflow ends
 liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.DownloadAsPdf, payload => {
     console.log('download PDF', payload)
 })
----

[#use-cases]
=== Common Use cases
Embed events can be used to trigger a specific response when the event is emitted, handle load and errors for embedded components, or modify a behavior in the embedded view.

==== Handle event response for embedded components

To handle event response when the event emits, you can add a callback function.

In this example, a callback function is added to show the loader when the embedded Liveboard initializes:

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Init, showLoader)
//show a loader
function showLoader() {
    document.getElementById("loader");
}
----

You can also trigger a host event when an embed event is fired.
In this example, the `HostEvent.SetVisibleVizs` is triggered to set the visualizations on a Liveboard when `EmbedEvent.LiveboardRendered` fires.

[source,JavaScript]
----
 // Emit when the Liveboard is rendered
 liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.LiveboardRendered, () => {
     // Trigger the SetVisibleVizs host event
     liveboardEmbed.trigger(HostEvent.SetVisibleVizs, ['viz1', 'viz2']);
 });
----

==== Handle load and errors for embedded components

A common workflow is to use an overlay `div` element to hide the embed content until you know that SSO is completed, and the content is fully loaded. If an error occurs in the process, you may prefer to display your own custom message to the end user rather than showing embedded ThoughtSpot content in an error state.

Embed events fire at different points within the loading process. The following events are related to the load process:

. `Init` +
Fires at the beginning of the loading process.
. `NoCookieAccess` +
Some browsers (Safari in particular) default to strict settings on cookie origins that prohibit the standard SSO process. This event fires if cookies are restricted by a user's browser.
. `AuthExpire` +
Fires if SSO does not complete and if the ThoughtSpot session times out at some point. Listen to the `AuthExpire` event in the load process to determine when it is safe to show the ThoughtSpot content and listen to it after loading to hide the ThoughtSpot login screen if the session expires for some reason.
. `AuthInit` +
Fires when the SSO process is completed correctly. The event does not fire when an SSO process fails. The logged-in user GUID is available in the `AuthInit` event response.
. `Error` +
Fires when an error occurs in the embedded app. For information about error types, see xref:embed-events.adoc#errorType[Error types].
. `Load` +
Fires as soon as the area for embedding is created, not when the content has begun or finished loading.
. `LiveboardRendered` +
Fires only on `LiveboardEmbed` components when the Liveboard or visualization container loads.

You can use both `EmbedEvent.AuthExpire` and `EmbedEvent.AuthInit` together to determine if the SSO process is completed correctly. +
To determine if `AuthExpire` is firing because SSO did not complete or if the ThoughtSpot session has timed out, you can set a variable to act as a flag to determine if SSO is completed.  +
When `AuthInit` fires, set the flag to *true*. You can also associate a callback function to `AuthExpire` to look up the flag to determine which state change has caused the `AuthExpire` event to fire.

In the following example, the `tsLoggedIn` flag is set to indicate the SSO login state.

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Instantiate class for embedding a Liveboard
const embed = new LiveboardEmbed("#thoughtspot-embed", {
    liveboardId: '<Liveboard-guid>',
});
let tsLoggedIn = false;
embed
    .on(EmbedEvent.Init, showLoader)
    .on(EmbedEvent.NoCookieAccess, showCookieSettingsMsg)
    .on(EmbedEvent.AuthInit, (response) => {
        // Set that AuthInit has fired
        tsLoggedIn = true;
        // authInit returns object -> {type: 'authInit', data: {userGuid: <guid>} } }
        let userGUID = response.data.userGuid;
    })
    .on(EmbedEvent.AuthExpire, (response) => {
        // Handle if session dies while content shows
        if (tsLoggedIn == true) {
            tsSessionTimeoutCleanup();
        } else {
            // Display custom message if SSO issues
            showSSOFailedMsg();
        }
    })
    .on(EmbedEvent.Error, showGenericErrorMsg)
    .on(EmbedEvent.LiveboardRendered, hideLoader)
    .render()
----

[#errorType]
===== Error types

The `EmbedEvent.Error` is fired when the following types of errors occur.

* `API` +
API call failure error. This error event occurs when an API request is blocked.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
SearchEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { type: "Error", data: { errorType: "API", error: { message: '...', error: '...' } } }
});
----

* `FULLSCREEN` +
Error in presenting a Liveboard or visualization in the full screen mode.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
LiveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { type: "Error", data: { errorType: "FULLSCREEN", error: {
    //   message: "Fullscreen API is not enabled",
    // } }}
})
----

* `SINGLE_VALUE_FILTER` +
Error in updating filter values. This error occurs when a single value filter is applied on a Liveboard and the user tries to update this filter with multiple values.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
LiveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { type: "Error", data: { errorType: "SINGLE_VALUE_FILTER", error: {
    //  message: "Filter {filter_name}: Cannot pass multiple filtering elements to this single value filter.",
    // } }}
})
----

* `NON_EXIST_FILTER` +
Error in applying filter due to a non-existent filter.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
LiveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { type: "Error", data: { errorType: "NON_EXIST_FILTER", error: {
    //  message: "UpdateFilters could not update the filter on {filter_name} as it is not an existing filter in the Liveboard. Please edit the Liveboard and add {filter_name} as a filter chip in order to update it programmatically.",
    // } }}
})
----

* `INVALID_DATE_VALUE` +
Error due to invalid date value in a filter. For example, if the column name is `Commit Date` and a correct date value is not specified, the `INVALID_DATE_VALUE` error event is fired.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
LiveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { type: "Error", data: { errorType: "INVALID_DATE_VALUE", error: {
    //  message: "UpdateFilters could not update the filter on {filter_name} as invalid date value provided.",
    // } }}
})
----

* `INVALID_OPERATOR` +
Error due to an invalid operator in filter properties. For example, if you try to apply filters on the `Revenue` column with the operator as `LT` and specify multiple values, it may result in an error.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
LiveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error, (error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { type: "Error", data: { errorType: "INVALID_OPERATOR", error: {
    //  message: "UpdateFilters could not update the filter on {filter_name} as invalid operator value provided.",
    // } }}
})
----

==== Modify a behavior
Embed events can also be used to modify a specific behavior in the embedded app. For example, the `hideResults` parameter in the `SearchEmbed` constructor blocks the *GO* button from displaying the chart or table results. When this attribute is set to *true*, you can listen to the `QueryChanged` event to perform actions based on the user's interaction within the `SearchEmbed` component.


[#customAction]
==== Handle custom action events

If you have added a xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[custom action] set as a xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[callback action], you must register an event handler to send data in a payload when the custom action is triggered:

[source,JavaScript]
----
searchEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.customAction, payload => {
    const data = payload.data;
    if (data.id === 'show-data') {
        console.log('Custom Action event:', data.embedAnswerData);
    }
})
----

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, (payload) => {
     if (payload.data.id === 'show-data') {
      const showActionId = 'show-data';
          if (payload.id === showActionId \|\| payload.data.id === showActionId) {
               showData(payload);
          }
      })
----

=== Event configuration for React components
If you are using React components to embed, you can register to any `EmbedEvent` by using the `on<EventName>` convention, for example,`onAlert`, `onCopyToClipboard`.

To trigger events on ThoughtSpot components embedded in a React app, import the `useEmbedRef` hook.

[source,TypeScript]
----
import { LiveboardEmbed, EmbedEvent, useEmbedRef } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/react';

// ...
const MyComponent = ({ dataSources }) => {
     const onLoad = () => {
     console.log(EmbedEvent.Load, {});
     };

     return (
         <SearchEmbed
             dataSources={dataSources}
             onLoad = {logEvent("Load")}
         />
    );
};
----

=== Event enumerations and examples
For information about the supported event objects and examples, see xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[EmbedEvent].

[#host-events]
== Host events

Host events are triggered by the host application in which ThoughtSpot components are embedded. Host events use the `.trigger()` method to send the event message to embedded ThoughtSpot components in the `.trigger(hostEvent, data)` format. The host events are part of the *HostEvent* object; for example, `HostEvent.SetVisibleVizs`.

=== Register event listeners
To configure host events, import the `HostEvent` library into your application setup.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
  //...
  HostEvent
} from "@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk";
----

In the following example, the `HostEvent.SetVisibleTabs` triggers an action to display the tabs specified in the code on an embedded Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.trigger(HostEvent.SetVisibleTabs, [
 '430496d6-6903-4601-937e-2c691821af3c',
 'f547ec54-2a37-4516-a222-2b06719af726'])
----

=== Handle events and trigger actions
Host events can be assigned to a custom button or action, on clicking which the event is triggered and initiates the specified action.

xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters] can be set programmatically before loading the embedded ThoughtSpot content. Runtime filters can also be updated after the load time using `HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters`. You can add a UI option or button in your embedding app and assign the `HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters` to trigger the `UpdateRuntimeFilters` event when that button is clicked.

In this example, the host event is assigned to a button for updating runtime filters. When a user clicks this button, the `HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters` is triggered and an action is initiated to update the filters with the attributes specified in the code.

[source,JavaScript]
----
 document.getElementById('updateFilters').addEventListener('click', e => {
     liveboardEmbed.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [{
             columnName: "state",
             operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
             values: ["michigan"]
         },
         {
             columnName: "item type",
             operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
             values: ["Jackets"]
         }
     ]);
 });
----

==== Filter from selection
Filtering from a selection on a chart or table can be implemented by combining the `EmbedEvent.VizPointClick` or `EmbedEvent.VizPointDoubleClick` events with the `HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters` event.

The callback function from the `VizPointClick` event will need to read the response, parse out the attributes from the response that will be sent to the Runtime Filters object, and then send the attributes and their target fields in the format used by `UpdateRuntimeFilters`.

=== Trigger actions without opening modals

To optimize user interactions and provide uninterrupted experience for workflows such as pinning an Answer to a Liveboard or saving a search result as an Answer, you can pre-define parameter values in host event objects and trigger actions directly without additional user input. For host events such as `HostEvent.Pin` and `HostEvent.SaveAnswer`, the SDK provides the option to define a set of parameters to complete the *Pin* or *Save* action without opening modals.

==== Parameters for HostEvent.Pin
When defining `HostEvent.Pin`, you can use any of the following parameter keys to pin an Answer to Liveboard programmatically without opening the *Pin to Liveboard* modal.

To add a visualization or Answer object to a Liveboard, use the following parameters:

* `vizId` +
__String__. GUID of the Answer or visualization to pin on a Liveboard
* `liveboardId` +
__String__. GUID of the Liveboard to pin the Answer.
* `tabId` +
__String__. GUID of the Liveboard tab. Adds the Answer to the Liveboard tab specified in the code.

In this example, when the `HostEvent.Pin` is triggered, the *Pin* action is initiated to add a visualization to the Liveboard tab defined in the code:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const pinResponse = await embed.trigger(HostEvent.Pin, {
    vizId: "8fbe44a8-46ad-4b16-8d39-184b2fada490",
    liveboardId: "fa68ae91-7588-4136-bacd-d71fb12dda69",
    tabId: "c135113c-fba0-4220-8e14-7a5f14e0e69f",
});
----

If the Liveboard to pin a visualization does not exist in your app, you can create a new Liveboard object and dd the visualization using the following parameters:

* `newLiveboardName`
__String__. Name of the Liveboard. Creates a new Liveboard object with the specified name.
* `newTabName` +
__String__. Name of the Liveboard. Adds a new tab to the Liveboard specified in the code.
* `newVizName` +
__String__. Adds or edits the title of a visualization.

In this example, when the `HostEvent.Pin` is triggered, the *Pin* action is initiated to create a new Liveboard and tab, and then adds the visualization to the new Liveboard object.

[source,JavaScript]
----
const pinResponse = await embed.trigger(HostEvent.Pin, {
    vizId: "50efca7c-703e-44ff-82b8-91f24b84da77",
    newVizName: `Sales by region`,
    newLiveboardName: "Sales performance",
    tabName: "Products",
});
----

If no parameters are defined in the `HostEvent.Pin` object, the event triggers the *Pin* action and opens the *Pin to Liveboard* modal.

==== Parameters for HostEvent.SaveAnswer

For `HostEvent.SaveAnswer`, you can pass the pre-defined attributes such as name and description of the Answer to save the Answer programmatically without showing the *Describe your Answer* prompt to user.

* `name` +
__String__. Name string for the Answer object.
* `description` +
__String__. Description text for the Answer


[source,JavaScript]
----
const saveAnswerResponse = await embed.trigger(HostEvent.SaveAnswer, {
    name: "Sales by states",
    description: "Total sales by states in MidWest",
});
----

If no parameters are defined in the `HostEvent.SaveAnswer` object, the event triggers the save action and opens the *Describe your Answer* modal.

=== Event configuration for React components

To trigger events on ThoughtSpot components embedded in a React app, use the `useEmbedRef` hook and set the ref to `embedRef` constructor prop with `.trigger` method.

[source,TypeScript]
----
import { LiveboardEmbed, HostEvent, useEmbedRef } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/react';

// ..
const embedRef = useEmbedRef < typeof LiveboardEmbed > ();

const resetFilter = () => {
    embedRef.current.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [{
            columnName: "state",
            operator: "EQ",
            values: []
        },
        {
            columnName: "product type",
            operator: "EQ",
            values: []
        }
    ]);
};
----

=== Try out in Playground

To explore the host event functionality in the Playground, follow these steps:

* Go to *Develop* > *Visual Embed SDK* > *Playground*.
* Select the feature to embed, for example, Search.
* Select the objects to load in the Playground.
* In the event handler code, add a host event as shown in the following example:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
document.getElementById('tryBtn').addEventListener('click', e => {
  embed.trigger((HostEvent.DownloadAsPng)
});
----
* Click *Run*.
* Click *Try Event* to trigger the action.

The following video shows how to register `HostEvent.RemoveColumn` and remove a column from the search query string using the *Try* button:

////

Verify the text for accuracy. QueryChanged can be fired on SageEmbed and SpotterEmbed as well.

==  SearchEmbed Events
There are several events that fire only on the `SearchEmbed` component:

* `DataSourceSelected`
+
Fires when a change occurs in the data sources, including the initial load of the `SearchEmbed` component. Can be used to hide a loader screen. Return object contains an array of the selected column GUIDs (accessible using `LOGICAL_COLUMN` type within metadata REST API commands).

* `QueryChanged`
+
Fires when a change occurs in the search bar, including the initial load of the `SearchEmbed` component. The returned object includes a `data.search` property with the TML search query from the search box.
