== UI and navigation experience

In full application embedding, the ThoughtSpot UI and navigation is available in the following modes:

* Classic experience (default)
* New modular home page and navigation with sliding panel[earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#
* New modular home page and navigation without sliding panel[earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#

=== New modular home page and navigation with sliding panel

The new navigation and modular home page experience provides an intuitive and efficient navigation structure. It organizes the application menu into persona-based modules designed specifically for their needs. Each module has a menu selector with a visual icon, to allow users to switch between contexts easily. Users can slide out the left navigation panel by clicking the hamburger icon in the header.

If your application instance has classic experience, you'll notice the following changes when the new experience is enabled:

* A redesigned UI with a sliding navigation panel.
* The app selector icons for *Insights*, *Data workspace*, and *Develop* appear in the header section of the left navigation panel. This selector provides access to persona-based apps, replacing the old top navigation menu. The left navigation panel provides quick access to different modules and can be customized.
* The *Admin* module is available under user settings section in the top right corner.
* The *Home* page is available in the *Insights* section. The Home page is customizable includes features such as Natural Language Search, watchlist, favorites, a library of Answers and Liveboards, and trending charts.
* The *Insights* section in the left navigation panel provides quick access to Home page, Answers, Liveboards and more. The panel also includes a list of user's favorites.
* The top navigation panel includes the following components:
** A Hamburger icon to allow users to slide out or slide in the navigation panel.
** Object search bar with a quick access to library.
** Alert icon that shows notifications
** Help icon to access documentation
** Org switcher to switch between Org contexts
** Access to *Profile*, *Admin settings* (if the user has administrator privilege), and *Sign out* options.

==== Modular Home page
The customizable home page in ThoughtSpotâ€™s new experience is available in the *Insights* section. It allows users to personalize the layout and content modules. Users can reorder sections such as watchlist, favorites, library, trending charts, and more. For full app embedding application users, developers can set a default layout to include only the modules they want.

==== Configuring new experience
The navigation and home page experience is turned off by default. Administrators can enable it on their instance at the cluster level for all users. When this feature is enabled on the instance,  users can switch between classic and new experience by turning off or enabling the experience in their profile settings. On embedded applications, you'll need to enable this experience using the `discoveryExperience` property as shown in this example:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
  // Enable the new modular home page and navigation experience
  modularHomeExperience: true,
  // Set the top navigation bar in the embedded view
  showPrimaryNavbar: true,
  discoveryExperience: {
    // Set the navigation bar to use the new sliding (icon-based) style
    primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding,
    // Set the home page to use the modular layout
    homePage: 'Modular',
  },
  //other options
});
----

==== Enable new experience mode for ThoughtSpot embedding
By default, the new navigation and home page experience is turned off on ThoughtSpot embedding applications. To enable the new experience mode for embedding application users, set `modularHomeExperience` to `true` in the `AppEmbed` component.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    pageId: Page.Home,
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

=== New navigation and Home page experience without sliding panel

In the new navigation and Home page experience, the app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] appears on the top header bar. The app selector consists of different persona-based contextual elements to allow users switch between contexts. On clicking an app from the application, the page corresponding to that app opens. Each application module has a separate left navigation panel.

If your application instance has classic experience, you'll notice the following changes in the UI:

==== Enable new experience mode without sliding panel
By default, the new navigation and home page experience is turned off on ThoughtSpot embedding applications. To enable the new experience mode for embedding application users, set `modularHomeExperience` to `true` in the `AppEmbed` component.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    pageId: Page.Home,
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

== Choose the default page to load
When embedding the full app, you can use either `pageId` or `path` parameter to specify the page to load when the embedded component loads. If both `path` and `pageId` properties are defined, the `path` definition takes precedence.

=== pageId
The `pageId` parameter of the `AppEmbed` xref:full-embed#_create_an_instance_of_the_appembed_object[parameters object] lets you specify the ThoughtSpot page in the `Page` enumeration that the AppEmbed component loads to. Valid values for this attribute are:

* `Page.Home` for the ThoughtSpot *Home* page +
* `Page.Search` for the ThoughtSpot *Search* page +
* `Page.Answers` for the *Answers* page +
* `Page.Liveboards` for the *Liveboards* page +
* `Page.Data` for the *Data* page +
* `Page.SpotIQ` for the *SpotIQ* analyses page

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    pageId: Page.Liveboards,
    showPrimaryNavbar: false,
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

=== path
The URL path of the ThoughtSpot application page that you want your embed application users to navigate to. +

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    path: 'pinboard/96a1cf0b-a159-4cc8-8af4-1a297c492ff9',
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

The following examples show valid strings for `path`:

[width="100%", cols="3,6,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Page| Classic experience | New navigation and Home page experience
|Home| `path: "home"` | `path: "home"`
|Answers| `path: "answers"`| `path: "home/answers"`
|Saved Answer| `path: "saved-answer/<answer-GUID>"` |`path: "saved-answer/<Answer-GUID>"`
|Liveboards| `path: "pinboards"`| `path: "home/liveboards"`
|Liveboard| `path: "pinboard/<Liveboard-GUID>"`| `path: "pinboard/<Liveboard-GUID>"`
|SpotIQ analysis list|`path: "insights"`| `path: "home/spotiq-analysis"`
|SpotIQ analysis page| `path: "insight/<spotIQ-analysis-GUID>"`| `path: "insight/<spotIQ-analysis-GUID>"`
|Data| `path: "data/tables/"`| `path: "data/tables/"`
|Worksheet, tables, views|`path: "data/tables/<object-GUID>"`| `path: "data/tables/<object-GUID>"`
|Monitor| `path: "monitor"` | `path: "monitor"` +
or +
`path: "home/monitor-alerts"`
|=====

=== navigateToPage()

The `AppEmbed` object has a method called `navigateToPage()` that will switch the currently loaded page in the ThoughtSpot embedded application. The `navigateToPage()` method accepts the values that work for `pageId` or `path` parameters.

The new navigation menu should call `navigateToPage` for the various pages you want to provide access to:

[source,JavaScript]
----
embed.navigateToPage(Page.Answers);
// with noReload option
embed.navigateToPage(Page.Answers, true);
----

=== history.back()
Page changes within the `AppEmbed` component register as part of the embedding app's history to the web browser. 

The standard JavaScript `history.back()` function will cause the `AppEmbed` component to go to the previously loaded page up until the very first ThoughtSpot page loaded within the component.

== Customize Search experience in full app embed

// ** Create a xref:embed-nls.adoc[Natural Language Search page using SageEmbed] and build a navigation to this page from your embedding application.

The search components available for full application embed and the configuration settings required for these components are listed in the following table:

[width="100%", cols="4,8"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Type| Description
|Object Search a| Allows finding popular Liveboards and Answers from the recommended suggestions.

On instances running 10.1.0.cl or lower, the Home page provides a combined interface with Object Search and Natural Language Search. On instances running 10.3.0.cl or later, with split search experience enabled, the Object Search will be the default search experience on the Home page.

The Object Search bar also appears on the top navigation bar if the top navigation bar visibility is enabled ( `showPrimaryNavbar: true`) in the SDK.

|Spotter Search | In addition to AI Search capabilities, Spotter provides a conversation interface for queries and follow-up questions. +
If Spotter is enabled on your instance, and `homePageSearchBarMode: "aiAnswer"` property is set in the SDK along with split search enabled (`isUnifiedSearchExperienceEnabled: false`), the search experience on the Home page switches to Spotter in full application embed.

For more information, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_enable_ai_search_with_spotter[Enable AI Search with Spotter].
| Search data a| Allows searching a data source using keywords and search tokens. This experience is available if you have set the `pageId` attribute to `Page.Search` or enabled navigation to the Search page of your ThoughtSpot application.
|Natural Language Search (legacy interface) a| Allows searching a data source using a natural language query string and get AI-generated Answers.
On instances running 10.3.0.cl or earlier, with split search experience disabled, the Search interface on the Home page provides a combined view of Natural Language Search (legacy interface) and Object Search. However, on instances running 10.3.0.cl or later, split search is enabled by default. Due to this, the Home page will not show Natural Language Search as the default search experience.

Note that the legacy Natural Language Search option is deprecated and replaced with Spotter Search. You can enable Natural Language Search with Spotter, by setting `homePageSearchBarMode` to `aiAnswer` in the SDK.

=== Home page search experience options

Developers can customize the Search experience by setting the `homePageSearchBarMode` property in the SDK to a desired value:

** `objectSearch` (default) +
Displays Object Search bar on the **Home** page.
** `aiAnswer`  +
Displays the search bar for Natural Language Search
** `none`
Hides the Search bar on the **Home** page. Note that it only hides the Search bar on the **Home** page and doesn't affect the Object Search bar visibility on the top navigation bar.

==== Enable AI Search
To set AI Search as the default search experience on the Home page, use the settings shown in the following examples.

==== Enable AI Search with Spotter (Recommended)
To set Spotter as the default search experience on the Home page, use the settings shown in the following examples.

== Customize navigation controls
The `AppEmbed` package in the Visual Embed SDK provides several parameters to hide or customize navigation controls.

The top navigation menu bar (classic experience), app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] (New experience), and left navigation panel on the home page (New experience) are hidden by default in the embedded view. To show these elements in the embedded view, set `showPrimaryNavbar` to `true`. If the navigation panel is visible in the embedded view, you can use the following parameters in the `AppEmbed` component for additional customization:

* `hideOrgSwitcher` +
Hides the Orgs drop-down. Applicable to only Orgs-enabled clusters.
* `hideApplicationSwitcher` +
Hides the app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu]. The app selector is available only in the new navigation and Home page experience mode.
* `disableProfileAndHelp` +
** To hide help and profile icons (Classic experience) +
** To hide help and profile icons, Help and Chat with Support menu options on the Home page (New Experience).

=== Help menu customization
On ThoughtSpot instances running 10.8.0.cl and later, a unified help and support experience is available. The new information center experience provides access to ThoughtSpot documentation and support and allows administrators to link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/customize-help[add custom links].

If you have embedded the full ThoughtSpot application with the top navigation bar and Help (?) icon with the `showPrimaryNavbar: true` and `disableProfileAndHelp: false` settings in the Visual Embed SDK and if you want to try the new information center experience, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_enablependohelp[enablePendoHelp] attribute in the SDK.

By default, the `enablePendoHelp` attribute is set to `true` for customer environments using the legacy information center generated by Pendo. To enable the new experience, you need to set `enablePendoHelp` to `false`.

[source,JavaScript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    ... // other options
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    disableProfileAndHelp: false,
    enablePendoHelp: false,
});
----

=== Customize the left navigation panel on Home page (New experience)
If the new navigation and Home page experience is enabled and `showPrimaryNavbar` to `true`, the home page displays a navigation panel on the left side of the Insights page. The panel consists of menu items such as Answers, Liveboards, SpotIQ Analysis, Monitor Subscriptions, and so on.

To hide the left navigation panel in the embedded view, set `hideHomepageLeftNav` to `true`.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    ... // other attributes
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    hideApplicationSwitcher: true,
    hideHomepageLeftNav: true,
    disableProfileAndHelp: true,
});
----

If you don't want to hide the left navigation panel, but show only a select few menu items, use xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenhomeleftnavitems [`hiddenHomeLeftNavItems`] array.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    hiddenHomeLeftNavItems: [HomeLeftNavItem.Home,HomeLeftNavItem.Liveboards],
});
----

== Customize Home page modules (New experience)
If the new navigation and Home page experience is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, the Home page shows modules such as watchlist, favorites, a library of Answers and Liveboards, trending charts and more. To customize these modules and the Home page experience, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenhomepagemodules[`hiddenHomepageModules`] array.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    hiddenHomepageModules : [HomepageModule.Learning,HomepageModule.MyLibrary]
});
----

To reorder Home page modules, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_reorderedhomepagemodules[ `reorderedHomepageModules`] array.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    reorderedHomepageModules:[HomepageModule.Search,HomepageModule.Favorite,HomepageModule.Trending]
});
----

== Hide columns on list pages
You can hide the following columns on the *Liveboards* and *Answers* listing pages using the xref:AppViewConfig#_hiddenlistcolumns[hiddenListColumns] array:

* Author
* Favorite
* Last modified
* Tags
* Share

To hide one or several columns on the list pages, pass the relevant list page column enumerations in the  `hiddenListColumns` array:

* `ListPageColumns.Author`
* `ListPageColumns.Favourite`
* `ListPageColumns.DateSort`
* `ListPageColumns.Tags`
* `ListPageColumns.Share`

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // hide Author, Share, and Tags columns on Answers and Liveboards list page
    hiddenListColumns: [ListPageColumns.Author,ListPageColumns.Share,ListPageColumns.Tags]
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `hiddenListColumns: [ListPageColumns.Share]` hides the *Share* column, but doesn't remove the *Share* button above the list. To hide both the column and the *Share* (xref:Action.adoc#_share[Action.Share]) button above the list, use the `hiddenActions` or `visibleActions` array.
====

== Detect changes in the currently loaded page
Various actions the user takes within the embedded ThoughtSpot application may cause navigation within ThoughtSpot. 

The embedding web application can listen for the `EmbedEvent.RouteChange` event by attaching an event listener to the `AppEmbed` object. The response has a `currentPath` property which is the path after the ThoughtSpot domain, for example:
----
pinboard/96a1cf0b-a159-4cc8-8af4-1a297c492ff9
----

To parse the `currentPath` into varying useful components, this `tsAppState` object code can be created in the global scope for use by any other web application code:

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Simple global object to handle details about what is visible in the AppEmbed component at a given moment
let tsAppState = {
  currentPath: startPath,
  currentDatasources: [], // Can be set later when detected from TML or other events
  // return back what is being viewed at the moment, in the form that will translate to the pageId property if captialized, or path property if not
  get pageType() {
      if (this.currentPath.includes('/saved-answer/')){
          return 'answer';
      }
      else if (this.currentPath.includes('/pinboard/')){
          return 'liveboard';
      }
      /*
      * Others are meant to match the exact pageId from SDK
      */
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/answer/')){
          return 'Search';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/answers')){
          return 'Answers';
      }
      else if (this.currentPath.includes('/pinboards')){
          return 'Liveboards';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/insights')){
          return 'SpotIQ';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/monitor')){
          return 'Monitor';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/data')){
          return 'Data';
      }
      else {
          return 'Home';
      }
  },
  // If viewing an Answer or Liveboard, returns the GUID of that object from the parsed URL
  get objectId() {
      let pathParts = this.currentPath.split('/');
      // '/saved-answer/' is path for Answers (vs. /answer/)
      if (this.currentPath.includes('/saved-answer/')){
          answerGUID = pathParts[2];
          return pathParts[2];
      }
      // '/pinboard/' is path for saved Liveboards
      else if (this.currentPath.includes('/pinboard/')){
          let pathParts = this.currentPath.split('/');
          // May need adjustment for tabbed views to add in current Tab
          liveboardGUID = pathParts[2];
          return pathParts[2];
      }
      else{
          return null;
      }
  }

}
----

The following example shows the event listener code updating the global `tsAppState` object above whenever there is a change within the embedded ThoughtSpot app:

[source,JavaScript]
----
embed.on(EmbedEvent.RouteChange, (response) => {
  // console.log("RouteChange fires");
  // console.log(response);
  // tsAppState object has currentPath property, which allows its other methods to parse out pageId, object type, GUIDs etc.
  tsAppState.currentPath = response.data.currentPath;
  console.log("TS App page is now: ", tsAppState.currentPath);
  
  // Update elements within your web application based on the new state of ThoughtSpot (adjust menu selections, etc.)

})
----

== Navigate using a custom action
To add a custom action for in-app navigation, follow these steps:

. xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[Add a custom action].
. Define the navigation path

In this example, the **view-report ** action on a Liveboard page calls the `navigateTo` method to open a specific saved Answer page when a user clicks the **View report** button in the embedded app.

[source,JavaScript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, async (payload: any) => {
    if (payload.payload.id === 'view-report') {
        appEmbed.navigateToPage(
            'saved-answer/3da14030-11e4-42b2-8e56-5ee042a8de9e'
        );
    }
})
----

If you want to navigate to a specific application page without initiating a reload, you can set the `noReload` attribute to `true` as shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, async (payload: any) => {
    if (payload.payload.id === 'view-report') {
        appEmbed.navigateToPage('saved-answer/3da14030-11e4-42b2-8e56-5ee042a8de9e', true);
    }
})
----

== CSS customization and hiding page elements
xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] allows overriding the default styles from the ThoughtSpot application, including the application pages.

If there is an element of a page that you dislike and cannot hide with any combination of other options in ThoughtSpot, you can often use CSS customization to target the element and apply either `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;` or `height: 0px;` and make it functionally disappear to the end user.

Specifying a direct element using the direct CSS selectors vs. the ThoughtSpot provided variables. To discover the appropriate selector, use the *Inspect* functionality of your browser to bring up the *Elements* portion of the browser's Developer Tools, then look at the *Styles* information.

An example of using direct selectors in a file is available in the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/complete.css[complete.css, target=_blank].

[source,css]
----
.bk-data-scope .left-pane .header-lt {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
----

Direct selectors can also be declared using xref:css-customization.adoc#rules[rules] in the Visual Embed SDK code. This is useful for real-time testing, particularly in the Visual Embed SDK playground. Note the format for encoding CSS rules into the JavaScript object format used by for rules.
