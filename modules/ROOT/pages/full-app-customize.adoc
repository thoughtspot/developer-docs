|Migration considerations| If you want to continue using the classic experience, no migration is required.
If you plan to switch to the new navigation and modular home page experience, ThoughtSpot recommends migrating to the new v3 experience.
| The v2 navigation experience can be enabled by setting  `modularHomeExperience` to `true` in the Visual Embed SDK. However, the new v3 experience with sliding navigation panel provides an improved experience and more customizable components for home page, therefore, we recommend using the v3 experience.
If you are already on v2 experience and want to switch to the new v3 experience, contact ThoughtSpot Support to enable this feature on your instance.
Once enabled, configure the `discoveryExperience` properties and customize your home page experience as per your embedding requirements.

== Customize the embedded application UI for your users

If your instance is on the V1 classic experience, you can switch to either the V2 or V3 experience. The V3 experience provides an enhanced user interface with granular control over home page and navigation customization.Therefore, ThoughtSpot recommends switching to the V3 experience directly.

Before updating the UI experience, review the xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_key_features_and_limitations[key features and limitations] of each UI experience mode, and verify whether the necessary customization controls for your embedding use case are available in the Visual Embed SDK.

=== Upgrade to the V3 experience
The V3 experience is disabled by default on ThoughtSpot Embedded instances.
To get started with the V3 experience for your embedding app, contact ThoughtSpot Support and ensure the V3 experience is enabled on your instance.

==== Upgrade from the V1 classic experience
If the V3 navigation and modular home page experience feature is enabled on your instance, use the following properties in the SDK to update your UI to the full V3 experience:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
  // Enable the V3 experience
  // Show navigation panels
  discoveryExperience: {
    // Enable sliding panel in left navigation
    primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding,
    // Set the home page to the V3 modular layout
    homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges,
  },
  //...other view config attributes
});
----
==== Upgrade from the V2 experience
If you are using the V2 experience, you can use the `discoveryExperience` property to upgrade to the V3 experience. Both V2 and V3 experience modes support a modular home page with customizable modules.

When upgrading, you can choose to keep the same modular experience from the V2 experience and enable only the V3 navigation panel.

To set your preference, set the `homePage` to one of the following values:

* `homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges` +
Enables the V3 modular home page experience. This option includes enhanced visual elements with additional customizable components.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
  // Enable the V3 experience
  // Show navigation panels
  discoveryExperience: {
    // Enable sliding panel in left navigation
    primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding,
    // Set the home page to the V3 modular layout
    homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges,
  },
  //...other view config attributes
});
----
* `homePage: HomePage.Modular` +
Enables the V2 modular home page layout. This option doesn't include the customizable components available in the V3 experience.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed('#tsEmbed', {
  // Enable the V3 experience
  discoveryExperience: {
    // Enable sliding left navigation panel
    primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding,
    // Enable the V2 modular home page layout
    homePage: HomePage.Modular,
  },
  //...other view config attributes
});
----

==== Notable UI enhancements in the V3 experience

After you switch to the V3 experience, the following features and enhancements will be visible:

* A sliding left navigation panel with the following components:
** The app selector icons for *Insights*, *Data workspace*, and *Develop* appear in the left navigation panel header.
** The *Liveboards*, *Answers*, *Search Data*, and *Spotter* menu options in the *Insights* section. The *Insights* panel also includes a list of users' favorites.
** The *Home* menu option in the *Insights* section.

* A top navigation header with the following components:
** A hamburger icon to slide in or close the navigation overlay
** Object search bar
** The alert icon that shows notifications
** Help and user profile icons. The user profile menu includes the *Admin settings* menu. This option is visible only to users with administration privileges.
** Org switcher to switch between Org contexts

* Home page experience
** Modular home page with specific sections for Search, Watchlist, Favorites, and so on.

The following figure shows the user interface with the V3 experience:

=== Upgrade to the V2 experience
To upgrade to the V2 experience, set the `modularHomeExperience: true` attribute in the SDK.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable the V2 experience
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    //... other view config attributes

=== Modular home page and navigation experience (V2 experience)

In the new navigation and Home page experience, the app selection icon appears on the top header bar. The app selector consists of different persona-based contextual elements to allow users to switch between contexts. Clicking an app in the app selector menu opens the corresponding application page. Each application module has a separate left navigation panel.

== Customize navigation experience

For information about the navigation elements in each UI experience mode and the related customization settings in the SDK, see xref:customize-nav-full-embed.adoc[Customize navigation experience].

== Customize home page experience
For information about the home page components and the related customization settings in the SDK, see xref:customize-homepage-full-embed.adoc[Customize home page experience].

== Set the default page for embedded view
For information about the default landing page settings for the embedded view, see xref:set-default-page.adoc[Set the default page].

== Customize list pages
A list page in ThoughtSpot refers to a page that displays a list of objects, such as Answers, Liveboards, and Liveboard schedules. The list pages include columns for sorting, filtering, tagging, and performing bulk actions such as marking favorites, sharing, or deleting objects.

To customize the columns in list pages such as *Liveboards* and *Answers*, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenlistcolumns[hiddenListColumns] attribute. Valid values that correspond to the column names on the list pages are:

* `ListPageColumns.Author` to show or hide the *Author* column
* `ListPageColumns.Favourite` to show or hide the *Favourite* column
* `ListPageColumns.DateSort` to show or hide the *Last modified* column
* `ListPageColumns.Tags` to show or hide the *Tags* column
* `ListPageColumns.Share` to show or hide the *Share* links in the column

The following example hides specific columns using the `hiddenListColumns` array:

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // hide Author, Share, and Tags columns on the Answers and Liveboards pages
    hiddenListColumns: [ListPageColumns.Author,ListPageColumns.Share,ListPageColumns.Tags],
    //... other view config attributes
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `hiddenListColumns: [ListPageColumns.Share]` hides the *Share* column, but doesn't remove the *Share* button above the list. To hide both the column and the *Share* (xref:Action.adoc#_share[Action.Share]) button above the list, use the `hiddenActions` or `visibleActions` array.
====

== Additional customization controls
xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] allows overriding default styles in ThoughtSpot application pages.

If there is an element of a page that you don't want to include or cannot hide with any combination of customization options available in ThoughtSpot and the Visual Embed SDK, you  can use xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] to target the element and apply either `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;` or `height: 0px;`, to make it functionally disappear to the end user.

To show or hide specific elements, you use direct CSS selectors or ThoughtSpot-provided CSS variables. To find the appropriate selector, use your browser’s *Inspect* tool to examine the style element in the *Elements* section of the browser's Developer Tools.

An example of using direct selectors in a file is available in the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/complete.css[complete.css sample, target=_blank] on the ThoughtSpot GitHub repository.

[source,css]
----
.bk-data-scope .left-pane .header-lt {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
----

You can also declare direct selectors using the xref:css-customization.adoc#rules[rules] property in the Visual Embed SDK configuration. This is useful for real-time testing, especially in the Visual Embed SDK playground. Note that the format for encoding CSS rules into the JavaScript object is the format used for rules.
