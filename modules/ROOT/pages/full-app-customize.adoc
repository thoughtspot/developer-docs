[IMPORTANT]
The V1 classic experience and V2 experience modes will be deprecated in an upcoming release in 2026. Therefore, ThoughtSpot recommends that you start upgrading your full app embedding implementation to the V3 UI experience.
--

== UI experience modes
The ThoughtSpot UI and navigation experience are available in the following modes:

* V1 classic experience (__Default experience__) +
* V2 experience
* V3 experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^  +

=== Key features

The key differences between these experience modes are described in this table:

[width="100%", cols="2,4,4,5"]

|Home page experience| Basic | Modular and customizable home page | Modular
|Enablement| The default, legacy ThoughtSpot UI. a| Disabled by default. +
Can be enabled by setting `modularHomeExperience: true` in the Visual Embed SDK a| Disabled by default. +
Can be enabled by setting the `discoveryExperience` properties in the Visual Embed SDK.
|Migration considerations| If you want to continue using the classic experience, no migration is required.
If you plan to switch to the new navigation and modular home page experience, ThoughtSpot recommends migrating to the new v3 experience.
| The v2 navigation experience can be enabled by setting  `modularHomeExperience` to `true` in the Visual Embed SDK. However, the new v3 experience with sliding navigation panel provides an improved experience and more customizable components for home page, therefore, we recommend using the v3 experience.
If you are already on v2 experience and want to switch to the new v3 experience, contact ThoughtSpot Support to enable this feature on your instance.
Once enabled, configure the `discoveryExperience` properties and customize your home page experience as per your embedding requirements.

== Customize the embedded application UI for your users

Before updating the UI experience, review the xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_key_features_and_limitations[key features and limitations] of each UI experience mode, and verify whether the necessary customization controls for your embedding use case are available in the Visual Embed SDK.

=== Upgrade to the V3 experience
If your instance is on the V1 classic experience, you can switch to either the V2 or V3 experience mode. We recommend migrating directly to the V3 experience, as it provides an enhanced user interface with granular control over the homepage and navigation.

Before you begin:

* Verify if your ThoughtSpot instance has the V3 experience enabled at the cluster level.
* Ensure that your embedding environment has the latest version of the Visual Embed SDK. The minimum supported version for the V3 experience is v1.40.0.
* If you are using direct CSS selectors for style customization, test your customization in the Playground before upgrading.
* If your embed uses action customization and the SDK events for app interactions, test your customizations for compatibility across different UI experiences to ensure seamless migration.

==== V3 experience settings in the SDK

To enable the V3 experience, you must use the `discoveryExperience` object in the SDK. This object supports the following properties:

* `primaryNavbarVersion` +
Enables the V3 experience. Valid setting for the V3 experience is `PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding`. +
If it is not set, no changes will be applied, and the currently enabled UI experience in your app will be retained.

*  `homePage` +
Enables the modular home page experience. Valid values include:
** `HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges`. +
Enables V3 modular home page experience. You must include `primaryNavbarVersion` to update the UI experience to V3 modular home page.
** `HomePage.Modular` +
Enables the modular home page experience with customizable components. This experience does not include the styling options and visual changes available with the full V3 experience.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* To enable the full V3 experience, both  `primaryNavbarVersion` and `homePage` attributes must be set in the SDK. Not setting `primaryNavbarVersion` will result in no changes in the UI experience.
* If you include only the `homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges` attribute in `discoveryExperience`, it will be ignored. +
* If you include only the homePage attribute with its value as `HomePage.Modular`, the v2 modular home page experience will be enabled.

For information about supported configuration combinations and the resulting UI experience, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_configuration_matrix_and_resulting_ui_experience[Configuration matrix and resulting UI experience].
====

==== Upgrade from V1 classic experience to V3 experience
The following example shows the code to enable the full V3 experience.
Note that the navigation changes will be visible only if `showPrimaryNavbar` is set to `true`.

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Import required components and enums for V3 experience
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    HomePage, // Enum for home page experience settings
    PrimaryNavbarVersion // Enum for V3 navigation experience
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable V3 navigation and home page experience
    discoveryExperience: {
        primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding, // Enables V3 sliding navigation
        homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges, // Enables V3 home page experience
    },
    // Show navigation panels
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    //... other view configuration attributes
});
----

==== Upgrade from the V2 experience to V3 experience
Both V2 and V3 experience modes support a modular home page with customizable components. The V3 modular home page experience includes additional improvements to the Watchlist, Trending, Learning, and Favorites panels.

To upgrade your UI to the V3 experience, set `homePage` to `HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges`:

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Import required components and enums for V3 experience
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    HomePage, // Enum for home page experience settings
    PrimaryNavbarVersion // Enum for V3 navigation experience
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable V3 navigation and home page experience
    discoveryExperience: {
        primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding, // Enables V3 navigation experience
        homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges, // Enables V3 modular home page
    },
    // Show navigation panels
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    //... other view configuration attributes
});
----
////
* `homePage: HomePage.Modular` for the V2 modular home page layout. This option doesn't include the customizable components available in the V3 experience.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
// Import required components and enums for V3 experience
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    HomePage, // Enum for home page experience settings
    PrimaryNavbarVersion // Enum for V3 navigation experience
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable V3 navigation and home page experience
    discoveryExperience: {
        primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding, // Enables V3 sliding navigation
        homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges, // Enables V2 modular home page
    },
    // Show navigation panels
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    //... other view configuration attributes
});

== Customize navigation experience

For information about the navigation elements in each UI experience mode and the related customization settings in the SDK, see xref:customize-nav-full-embed.adoc[Customize navigation experience].

== Customize home page experience
For information about the home page components and the related customization settings in the SDK, see xref:customize-homepage-full-embed.adoc[Customize home page experience].

== Set the default page for embedded view
For information about the default landing page settings for the embedded view, see xref:set-default-page.adoc[Set the default page].

== Customize list pages
A list page in ThoughtSpot refers to a page that displays a list of objects, such as Answers, Liveboards, and Liveboard schedules. The list pages include columns for sorting, filtering, tagging, and performing bulk actions such as marking favorites, sharing, or deleting objects.

To customize the columns in list pages such as *Liveboards* and *Answers*, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenlistcolumns[hiddenListColumns] attribute. Valid values that correspond to the column names on the list pages are:

* `ListPageColumns.Author` to show or hide the *Author* column
* `ListPageColumns.Favourite` to show or hide the *Favourite* column
* `ListPageColumns.DateSort` to show or hide the *Last modified* column
* `ListPageColumns.Tags` to show or hide the *Tags* column
* `ListPageColumns.Share` to show or hide the *Share* links in the column

The following example hides specific columns using the `hiddenListColumns` array:

[source,javascript]
----
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    ListPageColumns // Enum for columns on list pages
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // hide Author, Share, and Tags columns on Answers and Liveboards listing pages
    hiddenListColumns: [
        ListPageColumns.Author,
        ListPageColumns.Share
    ],
    //... other view config attributes

});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `hiddenListColumns: [ListPageColumns.Share]` hides the *Share* column, but doesn't remove the *Share* button above the list. To hide both the column and the *Share* (xref:Action.adoc#_share[Action.Share]) button above the list, use the `hiddenActions` or `visibleActions` array.
====

== Additional customization controls
xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] allows overriding default styles in ThoughtSpot application pages. You can also use xref:_theme_builder[Theme Builder] to explore the available CSS customization settings for the classic experience.

If there is an element of a page that you don't want to include or cannot hide with any combination of customization options available in ThoughtSpot and the Visual Embed SDK, you  can use xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] to target the element and apply either `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;` or `height: 0px;`, to make it functionally disappear to the end user.

To show or hide specific elements, you use direct CSS selectors or ThoughtSpot-provided CSS variables. To find the appropriate selector, use your browser’s *Inspect* tool to examine the style element in the *Elements* section of the browser's Developer Tools.

An example of using direct selectors in a file is available in the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/complete.css[complete.css sample, target=_blank] on the ThoughtSpot GitHub repository.

[source,css]
----
.bk-data-scope .left-pane .header-lt {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
----

You can also declare direct selectors using the xref:css-customization.adoc#rules[rules] property in the Visual Embed SDK configuration. This is useful for real-time testing, especially in the Visual Embed SDK playground. Note the required format for encoding CSS rules as JavaScript objects.
