== Customize the embedded application UI for your users

Before updating the UI experience, review the xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_ui_experience_modes[key features, limitations], and available SDK controls for customizing xref:customize-nav-full-embed.adoc[navigation] and the xref:customize-homepage-full-embed.adoc[home page].

For more information about the layout and UI elements in the V3 experience, refer to the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/thoughtspot-homepage[ThoughtSpot Product Documentation, window=_blank].

=== Upgrade to the V3 experience
If you are using the classic (V1) experience in your embed, ThoughtSpot recommends migrating directly to the V3 experience for an improved user interface, enhanced home page customization options, and navigation controls.

Before you begin:

* Verify if your ThoughtSpot instance has the V3 experience enabled at the cluster level.
* Ensure that your embedding environment has the latest version of the Visual Embed SDK. The minimum supported version for the V3 experience is v1.40.0.
* If you are using direct CSS selectors for style customization, test your customization in the Playground.
* If your embed uses action customization and the SDK events for app interactions, test your customizations for compatibility across different UI experiences to ensure seamless migration.

==== V3 experience settings in the SDK

To enable the V3 experience, you must use the `discoveryExperience` object in the SDK. This object supports the following properties:

* `primaryNavbarVersion` +
Enables the V3 experience. The valid value for the V3 experience is `PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding`. +
If this attribute is not set, no changes will be applied, and the currently enabled UI experience in your app will be retained.

*  `homePage` +
Enables the modular home page experience. Valid values include:
** `HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges` (__Recommended__) +
Enables the V3 modular home page experience. You must include `primaryNavbarVersion` to update the UI experience to the V3 home page.
** `HomePage.Modular` +
Enables the modular home page experience with customizable components. This experience does not include the styling options and visual changes available with the full V3 experience. We do not recommend using this option, as it will be deprecated in an upcoming 2026 release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* To enable the full V3 experience, both  `primaryNavbarVersion` and `homePage` attributes must be set in the SDK. Not setting `primaryNavbarVersion` will result in no changes to the UI experience.
* If you include only the `homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges` attribute in `discoveryExperience`, it will be ignored. +
* If you include only the homePage attribute with its value as `HomePage.Modular`, the v2 modular home page experience will be enabled.

For information about these configuration combinations and their effects, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_ui_customization_options_and_resulting_experience[UI customization options and resulting experience].
====

==== Upgrade from classic (V1) experience to V3 experience
To enable the V3 experience, set the `primaryNavbarVersion` and `homePage` parameters in the `discoveryExperience` object as shown in the following example.

Note that these attributes use the values from the xref:PrimaryNavbarVersion.adoc[PrimaryNavbarVersion] and xref:HomePage.adoc[HomePage] enumerations.

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Import required components and enums for V3 experience
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    HomePage, // Enum for home page experience settings
    PrimaryNavbarVersion // Enum for V3 navigation experience
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable V3 navigation and home page experience
    discoveryExperience: {
        primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding, // Enable V3 navigation
        homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges, // Enable V3 home page experience
    },
    // Show navigation panels
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    //... other embed view configuration attributes
});
----

==== Upgrade from the V2 experience to V3 experience
Both V2 and V3 experience modes support a modular home page with customizable components. The V3 modular home page experience includes additional improvements to the Watchlist, Trending, Learning, and Favorites panels.

To upgrade your UI to the V3 experience, set `homePage` to `HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges`:

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Import required components and enums for V3 experience
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    HomePage, // Enum for home page experience settings
    PrimaryNavbarVersion // Enum for V3 navigation experience
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable V3 navigation and home page experience
    discoveryExperience: {
        primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding, // Enable V3 navigation experience
        homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges, // Enable V3 modular home page
    },
    // Show navigation panels
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    //... other embed view configuration attributes
});
----
////
* `homePage: HomePage.Modular` for the V2 modular home page layout. This option doesn't include the customizable components available in the V3 experience.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
// Import required components and enums for V3 experience
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    HomePage, // Enum for home page experience settings
    PrimaryNavbarVersion // Enum for V3 navigation experience
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable V3 navigation and home page experience
    discoveryExperience: {
        primaryNavbarVersion: PrimaryNavbarVersion.Sliding, // Enables V3 navigation
        homePage: HomePage.ModularWithStylingChanges, // Enables V2 modular home page
    },
    // Show navigation panels
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    //... other embed view configuration attributes
});

** The *Home* menu option in the *Insights* section.

* A top navigation header with the following components:
** A hamburger icon to slide in or close the navigation overlay
** Object search bar
** The alert icon that shows notifications
** Help and user profile icons. The user profile menu includes the *Admin settings* menu. This option is visible only to users with administration privileges.
** Org switcher to switch between Org contexts

* Home page experience
** Modular home page with specific sections for Search, Watchlist, Favorites, and so on.

=== Upgrade from classic (V1) experience to V2 experience
Setting `modularHomeExperience` to `true` in the SDK enables the V2 experience.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // Enable the V2 experience
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    //... other view config attributes
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The V2 experience will be deprecated in an upcoming release. ThoughtSpot strongly recommends upgrading to the V3 experience to ensure continued support and access to the latest features.

== Customize navigation experience

For information about the navigation elements in each UI experience mode and the related customization settings in the SDK, see xref:customize-nav-full-embed.adoc[Customize navigation experience].

== Customize home page experience
For information about the home page components and the related customization settings in the SDK, see xref:customize-homepage-full-embed.adoc[Customize home page experience].

== Customize the default loading page and navigation routes
In full application embedding, the home page is set as the default landing page when the embedded app loads. You can xref:set-default-page.adoc[customize the default landing page settings] using the `pageId` or `path` attribute.

== Customize list pages
A list page in ThoughtSpot refers to a page that displays a list of objects, such as Answers, Liveboards, and Liveboard schedules. The list pages include columns for sorting, filtering, tagging, and performing bulk actions such as marking favorites, sharing, or deleting objects.

To customize the columns in list pages such as *Liveboards* and *Answers*, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenlistcolumns[hiddenListColumns] attribute. Valid values that correspond to the column names on the list pages are:

* `ListPageColumns.Author` to show or hide the *Author* column
* `ListPageColumns.Favourite` to show or hide the *Favourite* column
* `ListPageColumns.DateSort` to show or hide the *Last modified* column
* `ListPageColumns.Tags` to show or hide the *Tags* column
* `ListPageColumns.Share` to show or hide the *Share* links in the column

The following example hides specific columns using the `hiddenListColumns` array:

[source,javascript]
----
import {
    AppEmbed, // Main class to embed the full ThoughtSpot app
    ListPageColumns // Enum for columns on list pages
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    // hide Author, Share, and Tags columns on Answers and Liveboards listing pages
    hiddenListColumns: [
        ListPageColumns.Author,
        ListPageColumns.Share
    ],
    //... other view config attributes

});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `hiddenListColumns: [ListPageColumns.Share]` hides the *Share* column, but doesn't remove the *Share* button above the list. To hide both the column and the *Share* (xref:Action.adoc#_share[Action.Share]) button above the list, use the `hiddenActions` or `visibleActions` array.
====

== Additional customization controls
xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] allows overriding default styles in ThoughtSpot application pages. You can also use xref:theme-builder.adoc[Theme Builder] to explore the available CSS variables.

If there is a page element you cannot hide using ThoughtSpot or Visual Embed SDK options, you can use a CSS selector to target the element and apply CSS properties such as `display: none`;, `visibility: hidden`;, or `height: 0px` to hide it from the UI. To find the appropriate selector, use your browser’s *Inspect* tool to examine the style element in the *Elements* section of the browser's Developer Tools.

[source,css]
----
.bk-data-scope .left-pane .header-lt {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
----

An example of using direct selectors in a file is available in the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/complete.css[complete.css sample, target=_blank] on the ThoughtSpot GitHub repository.

You can also declare direct selectors using the xref:css-customization.adoc#_css_rules_using_selectors[rules] property in the Visual Embed SDK configuration. This is useful for real-time testing, especially in the Visual Embed SDK playground. Note the required format for encoding CSS rules as JavaScript objects.
