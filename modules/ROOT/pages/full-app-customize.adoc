The xref:full-embed.adoc[AppEmbed component] embeds the entire ThoughtSpot application experience within another page.

== UI and navigation experience
The ThoughtSpot UI and navigation experience is available in two modes:

* Classic experience (default)
* New navigation and homepage experience [earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#

=== New navigation and homepage experience

In the new navigation and homepage experience, the app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] appears on the header bar instead of the top navigation menu. The app selector consists of different persona-based contextual elements called apps. On clicking an app from the application, the page corresponding to that app opens. Each application module has a separate left navigation panel.

|Liveboards and Answers| In the classic experience mode, users can use All, Yours, and Favorites tabs to filter the Liveboards and Answers list| In new experience, the Liveboard and Answers list page provides filters for each column. For example, to view their favorite Liveboards, users can click the star icon in the column head and apply a filter to show only their starred (favorite) Liveboards. Similarly, users can filter the list by author to view only their Liveboards or Answers.
|=====

=== Feature limitations in the new experience mode
* Editing and Deleting of tags by administrators is not supported in the current release version.
* *Trending* module takes into account the count of the last 7 days to decide trending objects (Liveboard, Answer).
* Custom renaming of objects can break the *Favourite* and *Trending* modules.

== Enable new navigation and homepage experience on ThoughtSpot embedded app
By default, the new navigation and homepage experience is turned off on ThoughtSpot embedding applications. To enable the new experience mode for embedding application users, set `modularHomeExperience` to `true` in the `AppEmbed` component.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    pageId: Page.Home,
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

== Choose the page to load
When embedding the full app, you can use either `pageId` or `path` parameter to specify the page to load when the embedded component loads. If both `path` and `pageId` properties are defined, the `path` definition takes precedence.

pageId::
The `pageId` parameter of the `AppEmbed` xref:full-embed#_create_an_instance_of_the_appembed_object[parameters object] lets you specify the ThoughtSpot page in the `Page` enumeration that the AppEmbed component loads to. Valid values for this attribute are:

* `Page.Home` for the ThoughtSpot *Home* page +
* `Page.Search` for the ThoughtSpot *Search* page +
* `Page.Answers` for the *Answers* page +
* `Page.Liveboards` for the *Liveboards* page +
* `Page.Data` for the *Data* page +
* `Page.SpotIQ` for the *SpotIQ* analyses page
+
[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    pageId: Page.Liveboards,
    showPrimaryNavbar: false,
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

path::
The URL path of the ThoughtSpot application page that you want your embed application users to navigate to. +

+
[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    path: 'pinboard/96a1cf0b-a159-4cc8-8af4-1a297c492ff9',
    frameParams: {
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%'
    }
});
----

+
The following examples show valid strings for `path`:
+
[width="100%", cols="3,6,6"]
[options='header']
|=====
|Page| Classic experience | New navigation and homepage experience
|Answers| `path: "answers"`| `path: "home/answers"`
|Saved Answer| `path: "saved-answer/<answer-GUID>"` |`path: "saved-answer/<Answer-GUID>"`
|Liveboards| `path: "pinboards"`| `path: "home/liveboards"`
|Liveboard| `path: "pinboard/<Liveboard-GUID>"`| `path: "pinboard/<Liveboard-GUID>"`
|SpotIQ analysis list|`path: "insights"`| `path: "home/spotiq-analysis"`
|SpotIQ analysis page| `path: "insight/<spotIQ-analysis-GUID>"`| `path: "insight/<spotIQ-analysis-GUID>"`
|Data| `path: "data/tables/"`| `path: "data/tables/"`
|Worksheet, tables, views|`path: "data/tables/<object-GUID>"`| `path: "data/tables/<object-GUID>"`
|Monitor| `path: "monitor"` | `path: "monitor"` +
or +
`path: "home/monitor-alerts"`
|=====

navigateToPage()::

The `AppEmbed` object has a method called `navigateToPage()` that will switch the currently loaded page in the ThoughtSpot embedded application. The `navigateToPage()` method accepts the values that work for `pageId` or `path` parameters.
+
The new navigation menu should call `navigateToPage` for the various pages you want to provide access to:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
embed.navigateToPage(Page.Answers);
// with noReload option
embed.navigateToPage(Page.Answers, true);
----

== Customize navigation controls
The `AppEmbed` package in the Visual Embed SDK provides several parameters to hide or customize navigation controls.

The top navigation menu bar (classic experience), app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] (New experience), and left navigation panel on the home page (New experience) are hidden by default in the embedded view. To show these elements in the embedded view, set `showPrimaryNavbar` to `true`. If the navigation panel is visible in the embedded view, you can use the following parameters in the `AppEmbed` component for additional customization:

* `hideOrgSwitcher` +
Hides the Orgs drop-down. Applicable to only Orgs-enabled clusters.
* `hideApplicationSwitcher` +
Hides the app selector image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu]. The app selector is available only in the new navigation and homepage experience mode.
* `disableProfileAndHelp` +
** To hide help and profile icons (Classic experience) +
** To hide help and profile icons, Help and Chat with Support menu options on the homepage (New Experience).

=== Customize the left navigation panel on homepage (New experience)
If the new navigation and homepage experience is enabled and `showPrimaryNavbar` to `true`, the home page displays a navigation panel on the left side of the Insights homepage. The panel consists of menu items such as Answers, Liveboards, SpotIQ Analysis, Monitor Subscriptions, and so on.

To hide the left navigation panel in the embedded view, set `hideHomepageLeftNav` to `true`.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    hideApplicationSwitcher: true,
    hideHomepageLeftNav: true,
    disableProfileAndHelp: true,
});
----

If you don't want to hide the left navigation panel, but show only a select few menu items, use xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenhomeleftnavitems [`hiddenHomeLeftNavItems`] array.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    hiddenHomeLeftNavItems: [HomeLeftNavItem.Home,HomeLeftNavItem.Liveboards],
});
----

== Customize homepage modules (New experience)
If the new navigation and homepage experience is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, the homepage shows modules such as watchlist, favorites, a library of Answers and Liveboards, trending charts and more. To customize these modules and the homepage experience, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_hiddenhomepagemodules[`hiddenHomepageModules`] array.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    hiddenHomepageModules : [HomepageModule.Learning,HomepageModule.MyLibrary]
});
----

To reorder homepage modules, use the xref:AppViewConfig.adoc#_reorderedhomepagemodules[ `reorderedHomepageModules`] array.

[source,javascript]
----
const embed = new AppEmbed("#embed", {
    modularHomeExperience: true,
    reorderedHomepageModules:[HomepageModule.Search,HomepageModule.Favorite,HomepageModule.Trending]
});
----

== Detect changes in the currently loaded page
Various actions the user takes within the embedded ThoughtSpot application may cause navigation within ThoughtSpot. 

The embedding web application can listen for the `EmbedEvent.RouteChange` event by attaching an event listener to the `AppEmbed` object. The response has a `currentPath` property which is the path after the ThoughtSpot domain, for example:
----
pinboard/96a1cf0b-a159-4cc8-8af4-1a297c492ff9
----

To parse the `currentPath` into varying useful components, this `tsAppState` object code can be created in the global scope for use by any other web application code:

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Simple global object to handle details about what is visible in the AppEmbed component at a given moment
let tsAppState = {
  currentPath: startPath,
  currentDatasources: [], // Can be set later when detected from TML or other events
  // return back what is being viewed at the moment, in the form that will translate to the pageId property if captialized, or path property if not
  get pageType() {
      if (this.currentPath.includes('/saved-answer/')){
          return 'answer';
      }
      else if (this.currentPath.includes('/pinboard/')){
          return 'liveboard';
      }
      /*
      * Others are meant to match the exact pageId from SDK
      */
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/answer/')){
          return 'Search';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/answers')){
          return 'Answers';
      }
      else if (this.currentPath.includes('/pinboards')){
          return 'Liveboards';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/insights')){
          return 'SpotIQ';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/monitor')){
          return 'Monitor';
      }
      else if(this.currentPath.includes('/data')){
          return 'Data';
      }
      else {
          return 'Home';
      }
  },
  // If viewing an Answer or Liveboard, returns the GUID of that object from the parsed URL
  get objectId() {
      let pathParts = this.currentPath.split('/');
      // '/saved-answer/' is path for Answers (vs. /answer/)
      if (this.currentPath.includes('/saved-answer/')){
          answerGUID = pathParts[2];
          return pathParts[2];
      }
      // '/pinboard/' is path for saved Liveboards
      else if (this.currentPath.includes('/pinboard/')){
          let pathParts = this.currentPath.split('/');
          // May need adjustment for tabbed views to add in current Tab
          liveboardGUID = pathParts[2];
          return pathParts[2];
      }
      else{
          return null;
      }
  }

}
----

The following example shows the event listener code updating the global `tsAppState` object above whenever there is a change within the embedded ThoughtSpot app:

[source,JavaScript]
----
embed.on(EmbedEvent.RouteChange, (response) => {
  // console.log("RouteChange fires");
  // console.log(response);
  // tsAppState object has currentPath property, which allows its other methods to parse out pageId, object type, GUIDs etc.
  tsAppState.currentPath = response.data.currentPath;
  console.log("TS App page is now: ", tsAppState.currentPath);
  
  // Update elements within your web application based on the new state of ThoughtSpot (adjust menu selections, etc.)

})
----

== Navigate using a custom action
To add a custom action for in-app navigation, follow these steps:

. xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[Add a custom action].
. Define the navigation path

In this example, the **view-report ** action on a Liveboard page calls the `navigateTo` method to open a specific saved Answer page when a user clicks the **View report** button in the embedded app.

[source,JavaScript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, async (payload: any) => {
    if (payload.payload.id === 'view-report') {
        appEmbed.navigateToPage(
            'saved-answer/3da14030-11e4-42b2-8e56-5ee042a8de9e'
        );
    }
})
----

If you want to navigate to a specific application page without initiating a reload, you can set the `noReload` attribute to `true` as shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, async (payload: any) => {
    if (payload.payload.id === 'view-report') {
        appEmbed.navigateToPage('saved-answer/3da14030-11e4-42b2-8e56-5ee042a8de9e', true);
    }
})
----

== CSS customization and hiding page elements
xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization] allows overriding the default styles from the ThoughtSpot application, including the application pages.

If there is an element of a page that you dislike and cannot hide with any combination of other options in ThoughtSpot, you can often use CSS customization to target the element and apply either `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;` or `height: 0px;` and make it functionally disappear to the end user.

Specifying a direct element using the direct CSS selectors vs. the ThoughtSpot provided variables. To discover the appropriate selector, use the *Inspect* functionality of your browser to bring up the *Elements* portion of the browser's Developer Tools, then look at the *Styles* information.

An example of using direct selectors in a file is available in the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/complete.css[complete.css, target=_blank].

[source,css]
----
.bk-data-scope .left-pane .header-lt {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
----

Direct selectors can also be declared using xref:css-customization.adoc#rules[rules] in the Visual Embed SDK code. This is useful for real-time testing, particularly in the Visual Embed SDK playground. Note the format for encoding CSS rules into the JavaScript object format used by for rules.
