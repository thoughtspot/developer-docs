:page-title: Customize notification email settings per Org
:page-pageid: customize-email-apis
:page-description: You can rebrand system-generated notifications and customize notification emails


ThoughtSpot now provides REST APIs that enable developers and administrators to customize the branding, content, and visibility of components in notification emails.  ThoughtSpot embedded users receive notification emails for several events, including:

* ThoughtSpot welcome emails
* Sharing of Liveboards, visualizations, or saved answers
* SpotIQ analysis results
* KPI chart alerts

These APIs support customizations of the following parameters of the email template:

* Style customization, including font and email colour palette, allows you to set the look and feel, including fonts and colours, for a seamless product experience.
* Custom vocabulary for notification emails. This allows you to replace ThoughtSpot specific terms like “ThoughtSpot,” “Liveboard,” “Answer,” and "SpotIQ," with your product terminology.
* Customizing the company logo and the company contact details in the email footer.
* Customizing the visibility of actions like unsubscribe and mobile app nudge.
* Customizing the visibility of the *Privacy Policy* and *Manage Notification Preferences* components.


== Before you begin

* For REST API v2 operations, the Org context is determined based on the authentication token used in your API requests. Ensure you log in to the appropriate Org context from which you want to send API requests.
* Ensure that you have developer or administrator privileges for the Org.

[NOTE]
====
For overlapping components, customized configuration through these APIs overrides the email configuration through the *Admin* > *Onboarding* page of your ThoughtSpot instance.
====



//To try the API endpoints for the email customizations, see xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc[REST APIs v2].

== Create an email customization
To customize the notification emails for your Org, send a `POST` request to the  `/api/rest/2.0/customization/email` API endpoint, with the following parameters in the request body.

At any given time, only one customized configuration can be set for the notification emails of the Org. The most recently set configuration will be the active one.
[NOTE]
====
The customized configuration set for the Org overrides the configuration set for the ThoughtSpot instance. However, any Org with no specific configuration will reflect the same configuration as for the ThoughtSpot instance.
====

== Validate the email customization
To validate your email customization configuration in ThoughtSpot, send a `POST` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/customization/email/validate` API endpoint.
This triggers a test email that reflects all the customizations you have configured. It allows you to confirm that customizations are applied as expected. You can adjust your configuration if needed and repeat the validation until done.

For users with developer privileges, the email will be sent to their email id. For users with admin privileges, the email will be delivered to the address associated with the ThoughtSpot account.
