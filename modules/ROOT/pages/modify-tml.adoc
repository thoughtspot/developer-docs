:page-description: Details of how to change TML files to achieve various transformations and goals


link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML), window=_blank] is slightly different for every object type, but all follow a general pattern that allows for programmatic editing.

This section describes how various objects and their connections to each other are represented in TML.

The xref:version_control.adoc[Git integration features] within ThoughtSpot automatically handle the relevant aspects of a typical development and deployment process.

Modifying TML programmatically is useful for more complex levels of transformations than the standard development and deployment practices handled by the Git integration capabilities, such as the following:

- Re-mapping of table objects between different data warehouse types
- Deploying dynamically generated data models from the data warehouse
- Translations or other variations from templates

You can use the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_tml[thoughtspot_tml Python library, window=_blank] to access and transform any of the properties discussed within this document, most of which are covered in the README and the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_tml/blob/v2_main/examples/common_attribute_changes.py[common_attribute_changes.py example script, window=_blank].

== Best practices
Because of the flexibility of the various data object types, there is no particular hierarchy to TML files, but rather just the following rules:

* Data objects can only be joined to other objects from a single connection
* Any single search (an Answer or a visualization on a Liveboard) can only connect to data objects from a single connection
The *Connection* is thus the natural packaging level for importing TML files, except for Liveboards which may contain visualizations connected to different *Connections*.

This is to say, for a given *Connection* you can always upload all TML files connected to that connection safely except Liveboards.

One best practice recommendation is to only connect *Answers* and *Liveboards* to *worksheets*. Although they can connect directly to *Tables* and *Views*, it is far simpler to adjust a single reference to one *worksheet* within the *answer* and *Liveboard* TML than many individual *tables*. The only exception is if you use a single *table* or *view* for the underlying search answer.

=== Export with fqn: property
Always export TML files with `export_fqns=true` (for versions lower than 9.0.0.cl, see xref:development-and-deployment.adoc#_notes_for_older_releases_8_9_0_cl_or_earlier_versions[Notes for older releases]).
 
The `fqn:` property provides the GUID of associated objects, which can be swapped out when moving packages of TML files between environments. The following is an example of the `connection:` property within a Table TML:
 
[source,YAML]
----
connection:
 name: Demo Connection
 fqn: 2aa36dbd-dda6-4497-a6db-bc47e128862e
----

You can always *remove* an `fqn:` property when uploading a set of TML with the intention of creating all new objects.

=== Name properties are identifiers in connected objects
When editing entire packages of exported TML files to be deployed in a different environment, you *must consider changes to identifiers in other "downstream" TML files*. ThoughtSpot will do the necessary updates on an existing data model. 

One of the most important examples is that the `name:` property of a column in a Table is used as part of the column identifier in connected Worksheet objects.

A Table object might have a column with a display name property (`name:`) that has been modified to be different than the `db_table:` property (the actual name of the column in the database itself):

[source,YAML]
----
table:
  name: FACT_RETAPP_SALES
  db: RETAILAPPAREL
  schema: PUBLIC
  db_table: FACT_RETAPP_SALES
  connection:
    name: Demo Connection
    fqn: 2aa36dbd-dda6-4497-a6db-bc47e128862e
  columns:
  - name: Sales Id
    db_column_name: SALESID
    properties:
      column_type: MEASURE
      aggregation: SUM
    db_column_properties:
      data_type: INT64
----

The connected worksheet TML referencing the same column would be as shown in the following example. Note that it is the formatted `name` property from the Table TML, not `db_table_name`.

[source,YAML]
----
...
  worksheet_columns:
  - name: Product Name
    column_id: FACT_RETAPP_SALES_1::Sales Id
    properties:
      column_type: ATTRIBUTE
...
----

The pattern for `column_id` is a combination of the `id` from the `table_paths` section along with the `name` property of the column in the table object: `{Worksheet.table_paths[n].id}::{Table.columns[n].name}`

This is the section in Worksheet where the first part of the identifier is defined as the `id` property (`table` property references the `tables:` section above in the TML file):

[source,YAML]
----
table_paths:
  - id: DIM_RETAPP_PRODUCTS_1
    table: DIM_RETAPP_PRODUCTS
    join_path:
    - join:
      - C_DIM_RETAPP_PRODUCTS
  - id: FACT_RETAPP_SALES_1
    table: FACT_RETAPP_SALES
    join_path:
    - join:
      - C_FACT_RETAPP_SALES
----

== Connections
Connections contain the details and credentials necessary to connect to a database. A TML representation of a Connection includes all the details of connection object.

[source,YAML]
----
guid: 46030ea3-ecba-4cbf-a02c-c2ef5d5f29f1
connection:
  name: SnowflakeConnection
  type: RDBMS_SNOWFLAKE
  authentication_type: SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  properties:
  - key: accountName
    value: <account-name>
  - key: user
    value: <user_name>
  - key: password
    value: "<password>"
  - key: role
    value: <role>
  - key: warehouse
    value: <warehouse>
  - key: database
    value: <database-name>
  description: ""

----

////
Connections do not have a TML representation, but can be created and modified via the xref:connections-api.adoc[data connection REST APIs].

There is a connection YAML file (not TML but similar) that can be exported to save all details except for the password, but you must translate that back into a REST API call to create or update.
////

ThoughtSpot does not enforce uniqueness on Connection names. As a best practice, assign unique names to connections.

For more information about Connection TML and its limitations, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml-connections[TML for Connections].

== Tables
link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html#syntax-tables[Table objects, window=_blank] represent an actual table (or view) within a database.

When importing a table through the ThoughtSpot UI, a table's display name will default to the table's name in the data warehouse, but you can change the display name to whatever you'd like. You can specify the display name within the TML document when creating a table via TML import by changing the `name` property, while leaving the `db_table` property as it was originally imported.

[source,YAML]
----
guid: <table_guid>
table:
  name: <table_name>
  db: <database_name>
  schema: <schema_name>
  db_table: <database_table_name>
  connection:
    name: <connection_name>
    fqn: <connection_guid>
 ...
----

=== Change table properties
You can replace the `connection: name:` or `fqn:` property to 'repoint' the *table* to a different data environment.

The `db`, `schema`, and `db_table` properties may also be changed easily along with `connection`, assuming the schema/structure (field names and data types) are identical to the original object.

=== Change or add columns
You can adjust the properties of existing columns or even add new column objects with TML.

When updating an existing object, do not change both `name` and `db_column_name` at the same time. The TML parser will consider this as a deletion of the original column and an addition of a new column.

If you are modifying a package of TML for deployment to a new environment, changes to `name` property have downstream effects in connected Worksheet files.

[source,YAML]
----
  columns:
  - name: Sales Id
    db_column_name: SALESID
    properties:
      column_type: MEASURE
      aggregation: SUM
    db_column_properties:
      data_type: INT64
----

=== Join relationships and row-level security rules
*To import joins, you must import all the related Table TML files together at one time*

Joins do not have separate TML representations, but are defined in the table TML in the `joins_with` section.

Row-level security (RLS) rules are defined in the `rls_rules` section of the table TML. Similar to the `joins_with` section, RLS rules must reference existing table objects for the TML to validate.

If you cannot upload your Table TMLs all at once and you are encountering errors with Import, you can try the following process to minimize any unresolved references:

 . Remove the `rls_rules` and `joins_with` sections from the TML document on the initial import of each table TML. Save the GUID of each newly created object where it can be referenced to the original GUID.
 . Check that all table objects have been created successfully on the ThoughtSpot server.
 . Do a second import of the TML documents with the `rls_rules` and `joins_with` sections. To update the new objects rather than the original objects,  specify the GUIDs of the newly created table objects on the server in the TML documents' `guid` property.

== Worksheets

Worksheets combine several *tables*, including *Views*, into a coherent data model optimized for searches. The link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html#syntax-worksheets[TML syntax for worksheets, window=_blank] defines all aspects of the *worksheet*, including the tables it joins together, the columns and their properties, filters, and so on.

If you want to change the values for an existing *worksheet* object, the `tables`, `joins` and `table_paths` sections are the most important.

The `tables` section is a list of table objects that exist on the ThoughtSpot Server. The `name` property is all that is included in an exported TML file, and this matches the `name` property of the table object. If there is more than one table object on the server with identical name properties, you must use the `fqn` property to specify the GUID of the particular table you want. However, the string value of `name` is used in the `joins` section, so the correct process for adding an `fqn` property is as follows:

So you go from
[source,YAML]
----
  tables:
  - name: <table_name_1>
----

to

[source,YAML]
----
  tables:
  - id : <table_name_1>
    fqn : <GUID_of_table_name>
----
The `name` property, which is now transformed into the `id` property, is used in the `joins` and `table_paths` sections that follow. Under `joins`, the `source` and `destination` properties take the string `id` property of a table in the tables list. In a TML file exported from ThoughtSpot, you won't have to make any changes, because this value will already be set to what was defined in the `name` property, and we've maintained that value by switching it to the `id` property.

Under `table_paths`, the `table` property also uses the values we moved to `id`. The list of join names under `join_path` will need to match the text value of the `name` element of an item in the `joins`. This should be valid as exported and not require any changes, but if you do change the `name` value of a join, you will need to update the value in the `join_path` list in `table_paths`.

[source,YAML]
----
  joins:
  - name: <join_name_1>
    source: <source_table_name>
    destination: <destination_table_name>
    type: [RIGHT_OUTER | LEFT_OUTER | INNER | OUTER]
    on: <join_expression_string>
    is_one_to_one: [ false | true ]
  - ...
  table_paths:
  - id: <table_path_name_1>
    table: <table_name_1>
    join_path:
    - join:
      - <join_name_1>
      - <join_name_n>
----

== Models

Like Worksheets, Models combine several Tables to create a data model optimized for Search. With Models, you can build a data model easily by dragging and dropping tables and columns and creating joins, and switch between Table and Column views.

TML for Models has a specific syntax and includes several parameters. It includes parameters that are explicitly defined. For example, if you do not have any filters on your Model, the `filters` parameter does not appear. You can add that variable to the TML file to specify filters for your Model. The `fqn` parameter is optional but is recommended to reduce ambiguity when there is more than one table object on the server with identical name properties. If you do not add the `fqn` property and the Connection or Table you reference does not have a unique name, the file import fails.

[source,YAML]
----
  model_tables::
  - name: <table_name_1>
    id : <optional_table_id>
    fqn : <optional_GUID_of_table_name>
----

If you edit the joins in a Model TML file, the modifications will apply only to that specific Model. The joins at the table level will not be updated. To modify table-level joins, you must edit the source table’s TML file.

The following example shows the TML syntax for Models:

== Answers

The link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html#syntax-answers[answer TML syntax, window=_blank] defines all aspects of a saved search and how it is visualized. The `tables` property is used to point to ThoughtSpot *table*, *view*, or *worksheet* objects, whichever the answer is connected to. 

As mentioned above, it is simpler to connect an answer to a single *worksheet*, so that you only have to update one reference in the `tables` section.

[source,YAML]

guid: <answer_guid>

  name: <answer_name>

    Description line 2
  tables:
  - id: <table_id>
    name: <table_name_1>
    fqn : <GUID_of_table_name>
 ...
----

== Liveboards

link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html#syntax-pinboards[Liveboards, window=_blank] include many different visualizations and define a layout of the visualizations elements.

It is *best practice* to only use *one worksheet* for all visualizations on a Liveboard. However, each visualization on a *Liveboard* can connect to different data objects.

=== Visualizations on a Liveboard
The individual elements on a *Liveboard* are referred to as visualizations and are defined in the `visualizations` section. 

A visualization on a Liveboard *is not linked* to any answer object outside that Liveboard.

When you pin an answer to a Liveboard, the full definition of the answer is copied into the Liveboard definition at that time. However, the capabilities and definitions for answers stored separately or on a Liveboard are identical.

Within the TML, the `visualizations` section uses the same syntax as a separate *answer* stored on its own, with the `guid` property of an individual answer replaced by an `id` property. The value for the `id` property is typically the word `Viz` and a number, `Viz 1`, `Viz 10`.

[NOTE]
====
If your instance is running 8.9.0.cl, do not create visualizations on a single *Liveboard* that connect to different *worksheets* with the *same name* (this is possible, as *worksheet* names are not unique) if you wish to do programmatic transformations, because it is impossible to add in the FQN properties based on just name if names are not unique.

=== Modifying Liveboard TML
[source,YAML]

liveboard:
  name: <Liveboard_name>
  description:
    This is a multi-line description of the Liveboard
    Description line 2
  visualizations:
  - id: <viz_id_1>
    answer:
 ...
----

The `layout` section is an ordered list with a `size` property for each visualization tile. If a visualization is added programmatically, it needs a matching entry in the layout section to determine how it appears within the Liveboard. Adjustments to the order within the Liveboard can be made by reordering the layout list. The `visualization_id` property must match to an existing `id` value in the `visualizations` list.

[source,YAML]
----
  layout:
    tiles:
    - visualization_id: <visualization_id_1>
      size: <viz_id_1_size>
    - visualization_id: <visualization_id_2>
----


== Views

link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/complex-search/about-query-on-query.html[Views, window=_blank] transform a saved search into a data source, allowing for analysis that would require complex sub-queries in SQL. *Views* can be joined with other data objects in a *worksheet*. The best practice is to make *views* available to *answers* and *Liveboards* through a *worksheet*.

The link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/tml.html#syntax-views[TML syntax for views, window=_blank] is similar to that of worksheets, in that it defines links to table objects on the ThoughtSpot server and join overrides using the `joins` and `table_paths` sections. What truly distinguishes a view is the `search_query` element, which contains a string using the xref:search-data-api.adoc[ThoughtSpot search syntax].

== SQL Views
A link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml#syntax-sql-views[SQL View, window=_blank] defines an underlying query directly to a *connection*. 

The `connection` property can be changed similar to a *table* object's TML either using the `fqn` property, while the `sql_query` property can be changed to a different valid text string.
