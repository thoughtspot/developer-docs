:page-description: Use the publishing feature to distrubute and propagete objects to Orgs within a ThoughtSpot instance.

The publishing feature [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ enables administrators to efficiently manage and propagate objects such as Liveboards and Answers across multiple Orgs within a multi-tenant ThoughtSpot instance.

Unlike the deployment method that relies on TML import and Git integration, the publishing feature allows administrators to create an object in the Primary Org and publish it directly to target Orgs without creating duplicate copies of the object. The publishing feature also provides the ability to customize the object properties of the underlying Table or Connection using variables specific to each Org.

To streamline the publishing process programmatically, ThoughtSpot provides a set of REST APIs starting from the 10.10.0.cl release. Administrators can use these APIs to create and assign variables, parameterize object properties, and then publish objects and synchronize updates seamlessly from the Primary Org to other target Orgs on a ThoughtSpot instance.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The publishing feature, including the REST APIs for variable creation and edits, parameterizing metadata objects, and publishing content across Orgs, is in beta and turned off by default on ThoughtSpot instances. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

== When to use publishing feature

ThoughtSpot recommends using the publishing feature in the following scenarios:

* You have a multi-tenant ThoughtSpot instance with Orgs and your deployment requires the same metadata objects across different tenant Orgs
* You have set up multiple environments using Orgs on your ThoughtSpot instance. For example, you want to publish content from a `development` environment to a `test` or `staging` environment. In such cases, you can set the Primary Org on your instance as the development Org and publish content from the Primary Org to other target Orgs.

Currently, ThoughtSpot allows publishing content to different instances or Orgs via TML import and Git integration. The  Publishing feature automates some of these procedures and simplifies content propagation for large-scale deployments.

The following table lists the key differences and use cases for both these methods.

|=====
|Publishing feature |TML Import/Git-based Deployment and publishing
|Recommended for multi-tenant instances requiring standardized and re-usable content|
If a tenant Org requires unique customizations that cannot be handled by variables, use TML-based deployment to create and maintain a separate object for that Org.
|Allows publishing content from the Primary Org to different Orgs within an instance|Allows publishing content to Orgs within a ThoughtSpot instance, or from one ThoughtSpot instance to another
|Maintains a single source of the object and publishes content to Orgs without creating a duplicate object| Creates a separate copy per Org / per instance and can result in a higher memory usage.
|Allows customizing data properties with variables | Creates new copies per Org or instance and thus allows full customization of objects
|Automatically maps objects using variables and object IDs| Requires xref:guid-mapping.adoc[GUID mapping]

== Parameters and variables

The Connection and Table objects required for building analytics content can vary between data environments. To customize Connection and Table properties for each Org, you can use variables and parameterize object properties. This approach ensures that metadata objects dynamically adapt to the configuration of each Org, supporting multi-tenant scenarios and reducing the need to duplicate objects for each Org

You can create the following types of variables using xref:variables.adoc[variable API] and use these variables to parameterize Connection or Table properties via xref:metadata-parameterization.adoc[metadata parameterization API]:

* `CONNECTION_PROPERTY` +
The `CONNECTION_PROPERTY` variables allow parameterizing connection properties such as `accountName`, `warehouse`, `user`, `password`, `role` and so on.

* `TABLE_MAPPING` +
The **TABLE_MAPPING** variable allow parameterizing the following Table properties:

** `databaseName`
** `schemaName`
** `tableName`

* `CONNECTION_PROPERTY_PER_PRINCIPLE` +
Allows parameterizing connection properties per user or user group. However, it doesn't allow parameterizing core Connection properties such as `accountName`, `host`, or `port`. These properties must be derived from the connection configuration. +
This feature is disabled by default. To enable this option, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

The following figure illustrates variable substitution in Connections and Tables:

== Version control

For the objects in the Primary Org, you can use the xref:git_integration_overview[Git integration] APIs or UI for development, change tracking, and version control. However, Git integration is not supported for objects published in the target Orgs.

== User access to objects
ThoughtSpot administrator with access to all Orgs can publish content from the Primary Org to other Orgs on a ThoughtSpot instance. The administrators will also require edit access to the object and the underlying data source in the Primary Org.

The visibility of a published object in an Org depends on its sharing settings. Org administrators can view the objects published in their Org and grant view access to other users in their Org by sharing the object.

== Limitations
Note the following feature limitations:

* Only ThoughtSpot administrators with access to all Orgs can publish objects.
* Objects can be published only from the Primary Org to other Orgs. Publishing from non-default Orgs is not supported.
* In the target Orgs, published objects are available in read-only mode. The original object in the Primary Org remains editable by the cluster administrator and users with edit permissions.
* Spotter functionality is not supported for published objects.
* Search data indexing is disabled for published tables.
* Git integration is not supported for published objects.

////
* Cohort publishing is not supported.
* Custom calendars with different metadata across Orgs are not supported.

== Publishing workflow

The content publishing process with the new publishing method involves the following steps:

. xref:intro-thoughtspot-objects.adoc#_content_creation_workflow[Step 1: Create a master object] +
This step involves building Answers and Liveboard from a Model or data object in Primary Org. Ensure that the object references Tables or Connections that can be parameterized with variables.

. xref:variables.adoc[Step 2: Define variables] +
Create a variable with placeholder values for each Org and assign values using `/api/rest/2.0/template/variables/create` API. For example, you can create a variable for table attributes,  such as schema, database, or table name, and assign the variable to the relevant table properties in via metadata parameterization API.  When you publish the object, it will use the variable, and the correct value for that variable will be substituted based on the Org.

. xref:metadata-parameterization.adoc[Step 3: Parameterize metadata objects] +
Replace the static values of object properties with variables created from the previous step. You can use the `/api/rest/2.0/metadata/parameterize` API endpoint to assign variables to the relevant object properties. This step is required to enable the use of the same metadata object across different Orgs, with the actual values being supplied at runtime for each Org.

. xref:publish-api.adoc[Step 4: Publish the objects] +
Publish the objects from the source Org (Primary Org) to target Orgs using the publish metadata API (`/api/rest/2.0/security/metadata/publish`).

. xref:publish-api.adoc#_validate_published_objects[Step 5: Verify and update objects] +
After publishing an object, verify the published object in each Org to ensure that the variables are correctly substituted with the appropriate values for that Org.
Try updating the original object in the Primary Org, and verify whether the updates are automatically propagated to the target orgs and the published objects are synchronized.
