:page-description: Using ThoughtSpot's mobile embed SDKs, you can now embed ThoughtSpot in your mobile apps

ThoughtSpot provides the following SDK libraries to help developers embed ThoughtSpot in their mobile apps:

* xref:mobilesdk-quick-start.adoc[React Native Mobile Embed SDK] [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ +
 Allows developers to embed ThoughtSpot content in *iOS* and *Android* mobile apps using React Native resources and a single codebase.
* xref:mobile-embed-qs-flutter.adoc[Flutter Embed SDK] [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ +
Allows embedding ThoughtSpot components in Flutter apps.
* xref:mobile-embed-qs-swift.adoc[Swift Embed SDK] [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ +
Allows developers to embed ThoughtSpot content in an iOS native app.
* xref:mobile-embed-android.adoc[Android Embed SDK] [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ +
Allows developers to embed ThoughtSpot content in an Android native app.

== Authentication and security settings
Currently, Mobile Embed SDKs support only cookieless authentication (`AuthType.TrustedAuthCookieless`) method to authenticate embed users. To handle authentication, you may have to token provider function or use your backend app to fetch a token for trusted authentication. For more information, see the Mobile Embed SDK quickstart guides.

You must also add your embedding app domain to the following allowlists on the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page in the ThoughtSpot UI.

* CSP visual embed hosts
* Permitted iFrame domains
* CORS whitelisted domains

For information about how to add your domains to CSP and CORS allowlists, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security Settings].

To disable, show, or hide specific menu actions, specify the action IDs with the `disabledActions` `visibleActions` or `hiddenActions` array in your code. For additional information and code samples, refer to the mobile embed Quickstart guides.

== Style customization
To customize styles and rebrand your embedded view, use the CSS variables available with the customzation framework. For additional information and code samples, refer to the mobile embed Quickstart guides.

== Text string and icon customization
To customize text strings, use the `customozation` object with text string attributes as key-value pairs. For more information, see xref:customize-text-strings.adoc[Customize text strings].

For icon customization, you need to xref:customize-icons.adoc#_create_an_icon_override[find the ID of the icon that you want to replace and then replace it with your SVG]. You must also add the domain URL of your icon hosting site to the following CSP allowlists on the *Develop* > *Security Settings* page in your ThoughtSpot instance:

** xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-connect-src[CSP connect-src domains allowlist]
** xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-trusted-domain[CSP img-src domains allowlist]

== Filters and Parameters for embedded Liveboards
For Liveboard embeds in mobile apps, the SDKs allow adding, updating runtime filters and Parameters, and applying individual filters at the visualization level.
For more information about filter types, see xref:filters_overview.adoc[Filter overview] and xref:Runtime overrides[Runtime overrides].

== Events and app interactions

The embedded ThoughtSpot components emit events when they initialize, load, and when users interact with the embedded interface. The mobile embed SDKs provides a set of event handlers to listen to the events emitted from the embedded interface and trigger actions.

For more information about the events framework, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Events and app interactions], xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[Embed Events], and xref:HostEvent.adoc[Host Events].

== Known limitations

The mobile embed SDKs currently support embedding only Liveboards in mobile apps. The following features will not be available on the embedded Liveboard page in a mobile apps:

* Personalized views
* SpotIQ Analysis
* AI Highlights
* Renaming and making a copy of a Liveboard
* Scheduling Liveboard alerts and notifications
* Exporting or importing Liveboard TML
* Request Verification
* ThoughtSpot Sync features

The following Liveboard view configuration parameters are not supported in mobile embeds:

* xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc#_insertassibling[insertAsSibling]
* xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc#_prerenderid[preRenderId]
* xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc#_fullheight[fullHeight]
* xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc#_donottrackprerendersize[doNotTrackPreRenderSize]
