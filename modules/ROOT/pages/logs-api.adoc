:page-description: Log streaming service APIs

ThoughtSpot cloud deployments allow you to collect security audit events and send them to your Security information and event management (SIEM) application in real-time. These events can help your security operations personnel in detecting potential security threats or compromised user accounts in your organization.

The log API endpoint allows you to programmatically fetch security audit logs from the ThoughtSpot system.

=== Security Events
The API returns audit logs for the following security events:
