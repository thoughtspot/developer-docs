:page-description: You can set up your ThoughtSpot instance as a multi-tenant cluster

When building embedded applications with ThoughtSpot, *multi-tenacy* has two meanings:

- Multi-tenancy within the ThoughtSpot instance
- Multi-tenancy within the data warehouse

The combination of these two factors determines the preferred *xref:development-and-deployment.adoc[development and deployment pattern]* in ThoughtSpot.

== Multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot
Best practice for all structured xref:development-and-deployment.adoc[development and deployment] processes in ThoughtSpot requires utilizing multi-tenancy in ThoughtSpot via xref:orgs.adoc[Orgs].

By default, ThoughtSpot operates in a single-tenant mode, with all of the administration functions for Orgs hidden. If you need Orgs for a structured development and deployment process, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

xref:access-control-sharing.adoc[Access control (sharing)] and xref:data-security.adoc[row-level security] serve to separate out users and filter content within a single Org. This means a single "prod" org can serve all end customers, if the data warehouse design is itself multi-tenanted. 

== Multi-tenancy in the data warehouse
The exact deployment pattern chosen will depend on the design of your data warehouse.

At a basic level:

* if the prod data warehouse is *multi-tenanted* and all end customer data is in the same tables, then a xref:multi-tenancy-best-practices.adoc[single "prod" environment] can be used, with row-level security (RLS) and proper access control (sharing) configured to isolate users and show only their data

* if the prod data warehouse is *single-tenanted* and each end customer’s data is separated in different databases or schemas, then a xref:single-tenant-data-models.adoc[prod Org per end customer deployment pattern] is used, with the final deployment from a "release" environment to each individual "end customer prod" environment

The actual level of multi-tenant Org separation is totally up to ThoughtSpot Customer, dependent on your business requirements.
