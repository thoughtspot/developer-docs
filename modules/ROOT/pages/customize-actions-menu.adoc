:page-description: Overview of custom actions

The custom actions feature in ThoughtSpot allows users to push data to external applications. To allow ThoughtSpot users to quickly act on the data they analyze, custom actions must be pre-configured in their setup. ThoughtSpot users with developer or admin privileges can create various types of custom actions in the **Develop ** tab and make them available on a saved Answer or visualization page.

[NOTE]
====
The link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_EmbedEvent#_vizpointclick[VizPointClick HostEvent] behaves in the same way as a context menu custom action, but fires immediately on a click rather than from the right-click context menu.

== Custom actions page

To view the *Custom actions* page, go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Custom actions*.  

The following options are available on *Custom actions* page:

* *Overview* tab +
The default view which shows the possible locations for custom actions placement in the ThoughtSpot UI.
* *Actions* tab +
Lists the custom actions and allows you to edit and delete a custom action.
* **Create action** button to add a custom action. +
Developers can create a xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[URL action] to send data from an Answer or visualization to a target URL, or a xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[callback action] to trigger a callback event to the parent application and then pushes the Answer or visualization data in a response payload.

=== Global and local actions

Developers or administrators can set a custom action as a global or local action.

Global actions::

By default, a global action appears as a menu action in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]menu on all visualizations. 
+
Authorized users can edit the position of a global action on a visualization or saved Answer by using the edit icon in the *Custom actions* panel.

Local actions::

Local actions are not assigned to any visualization by default. Developers can create a local action and let users add this action to a specific visualization or the answers built from a specific Model.
+
Any user with edit access to a visualization or Model can assign a local action xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[to a specific visualization] or xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[all new visualizations generated from a specific Model].

[#access-control]
User access control:: 
For granular access control, developers can restrict a custom action's availability to a specific group. The **Show advanced availability** setting in the custom action creation page allows you to associate a custom action to one or several groups. 

=== Custom action placement in the UI

A custom action can be set as a primary button or as a menu item in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu or the contextual menu on an Answer or visualization.

By default, the custom actions are added as menu items in the  **More** options menu, unless they are explicitly set as *Primary* or *Context Menu* actions. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set obtained from a visualization in a custom action payload, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu.

[NOTE]
====
You can only assign one custom action as a primary button on a visualization or Answer.

// Outside of the custom actions framework, the SDK provides the `primaryAction` parameter, which allows setting a specific menu action from the system-defined actions list as a primary button on Liveboard visualizations. If a `primaryAction` is already assigned to a visualization, consider whether it is necessary to add your custom action as a primary button and how it might affect user experience.
====

=== Disable or hide a custom action

To disable, show or hide a custom action, specify the custom action ID in the `disabledActions`,  `visibleActions` or `hiddenActions` array. For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[show, hide, and disable a custom action].
