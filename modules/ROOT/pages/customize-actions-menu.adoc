:page-description: Overview of custom actions

The custom actions feature in ThoughtSpot allows users to push data to external applications. To allow ThoughtSpot users to quickly act on the data they analyze, custom actions must be pre-configured in their setup. ThoughtSpot users with developer or admin privileges can create various types of custom actions in the **Develop ** tab and make them available on a saved Answer or visualization page.

== Custom actions page

To view the *Custom actions* page, go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Custom actions*.  

The *Custom actions* page displays the **Create action** button, and the *Overview* and *Actions* tabs.


=== Create action

The *Create action* button allows you to create the following types of actions:

////
App actions::
An xref:app-actions.adoc[app action] connects a ThoughtSpot instance to an external app and pushes  data to a user's business workspace; for example, Slack. 
////

Callback actions::
A xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[callback action] triggers a callback event to the parent application and then pushes the Answer or visualization data in a response payload.

URL actions::
A xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[URL action] sends data from an Answer or visualization to a specific URL in a `POST` request.

Developers or administrators can set a custom action as a global or local action.

Global actions::

By default, a global action appears as a menu action in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]menu on all visualizations. 

+
Authorized users can edit the position of a global action on a visualization or saved Answer by using the edit icon in the *Custom actions* panel.

Local actions::

Local actions are not assigned to any visualization by default. Developers can create a local action and let users add this action to a specific visualization or the answers built from a specific worksheet. 
+
Any user with edit access to a visualization or worksheet can assign a local action xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[to a specific visualization] or xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[all new visualizations generated from a specific worksheet]. 

[#access-control]
User access control:: 
For granular access control, developers can restrict a custom action's availability to a specific group. The **Show advanced availability** setting in the custom action creation page allows you to associate a custom action to one or several groups. 

[NOTE]
====
In embedded ThoughtSpot instances, developers can also use the `visibleActions`, `hiddenActions`, and `disabledActions` properties to xref:embed-actions.adoc[show, hide, and disable a custom action].

=== Overview

The *Overview* tab shows the possible locations for placing a custom action in the ThoughtSpot UI. You can add a custom action in the primary menu bar, or as a menu action in the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu or the contextual menu that appears when a user right-clicks on an Answer or Liveboard visualization.

By default, ThoughtSpot adds all custom actions to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set obtained from a visualization, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu. To change the position of an existing custom action, click the custom action icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[custom action icon] on a saved Answer page, and then click the edit icon next to the custom action in the *Custom action* panel.

=== Actions

The *Actions* tab lists the actions created on your ThoughtSpot instance. 

* To edit an action, go to **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu > **Edit**.
* To delete an action, click **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu > **Delete**.
