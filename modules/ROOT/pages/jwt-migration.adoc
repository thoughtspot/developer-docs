:page-description: Steps for migrating your implementation to use custom token API workflow

If your application instance is upgraded 10.4.0.cl or later version, ThoughtSpot recommends using the the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom</a>+++ API endpoint to xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[generate a JWT token with custom security rules] instead of the `user_parameters` property in `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` APIs. The `user_parameters` property is deprecated in 10.4.0.cl.

If your current application environment is using the beta version of the ABAC, follow the steps described in this article to smoothly migrate your ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` API endpoint to the new `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API workflow. If you need additional help and assistance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

== Feature rollout

To control the enablement and rollout of the ABAC via tokens feature, ThoughtSpot provides the following configuration settings:

* `jwTokenFeatureEnabled` +
Enabled by default on all ThoughtSpot instances running 9.12.5.cl and later. It controls the availability of the beta version of the ABAC token workflow.
* `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` +
Disabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances. It controls the availability of the ABAC token generation method via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint.
* `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` +
Enabled by default on all instances running 10.5.0.cl and later. This setting governs which API endpoint is used for ABAC token generation. When set to `true`, the ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` API endpoint is explicitly chosen as the default JWT token method for the cluster, regardless of the status of the `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` flag.

== User properties

In the beta version of ABAC implementation with the V2.0 Get token APIs (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object`), security attributes are stored in the `user` > `user_parameters` object. To avoid ambiguity during the migration, ThoughtSpot uses a different user property to store security rules and other specifications defined via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint. For all ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API workflow, the user's security entitlement details are stored in the `user` > `access_control_properties` object as shown in this example:

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If the `persist` attribute is set as `true` for the beta version of the JWT tokens generated using the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint, it will be updated as `"persist_option": "REPLACE"` in the user's `access_control_properties` after migration. +
On instances running 10.4.0.cl, the persist option for the tokens generated using the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API appends new conditions by default, instead of replacing the existing rules. To replace the persisted attributes, set `persist_option=RESET` via a POST API call to `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`, and then send another API request with `persist_option=APPEND`.

* The JWT tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` do not support runtime sorting.  If there are  any runtime sorting rules applied via JWT tokens generated from the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call, they will be ignored during migration.
====

== Migration steps

This document assumes that you are currently using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` to create a JWT token to log in your users and to apply persisting security rules for user sessions in the `user_parameters` property of the user object.

////
=== Step 1: Verify the JWT token generation settings on your instance

. Ensure that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `true` on your ThoughtSpot instance. To check the status of this flag, send a `GET` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/system/config-overrides` API endpoint.

      "current": false
    }
  }
}
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your ThoughtSpot instance is running 10.3.0.cl or earlier version, you must ensure that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`. If this feature flag is not enabled on your instance, contact ThoughSpot Support before attempting to migrate your ABAC API workflow.
====

. Verify that you are using `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` to generate tokens for ABAC for your users.
. Verify that your users have persisted data security values. To check this, send a `POST` request body with the user IDs or names to the `POST /api/rest/2.0/users/search` API endpoint and verify the persist property settings under `user_parameters` in the API response.

////

=== Step 1: Enable the workflow with custom token API endpoint

Create a ThoughtSpot Support request and ask for the JWT settings to be enabled on your instance. These settings will include the following:

* A quick patch of your environment that adds the JWT flags to your instance.
* Enabling the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting to ensure that your current JWT setup is honored while you work on the migration steps.
* Setting the `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` attribute to `true` that allows you to set up security by default on the Worksheets or Models that you want to use for JWT security entitlements.

=== Step 2: Flag columns whose data will be secured using the JWT endpoint.

Navigate to your Worksheets / Models and set `is_mandatory_token_filter` to `true` on columns that you wish to secure via `filter_rules` set for ABAC.

For more information about `filter_rules`, see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions].

=== Step 3: Familiarize with the custom token authentication endpoint

After migration or upgrade to ThoughtSpot 10.4.0.cl or later, you'll need to use the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint to apply security entitlements via JWT authentication tokens.

We recommend using the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">REST API v2 Playground</a>+++ to familiarize yourself with the request payload and send test requests to demo users. Note that your production users will still be authenticated and secured via the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint until you complete the migration steps.

=== Step 4: Create a script to migrate to the new endpoint

Before creating a script, check the status of the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag on your instance:

. Send a `GET` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/system/config-overrides` API endpoint.
The API returns the configuration override details in the response.
. Search for `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` and check its current state.

{
  "config_override_info": {
    "honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint": {
      "category": "MAIN",
      "dataType": "BOOLEAN",
      "description": "Flag to enable honoring of JWT Token where from Beta Endpoint.",
      "current": true
    }
  }
}
----

As long as the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `true`, the rules defined via tokens generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call are applied to user profiles.
To apply the rules defined via `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint, `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` must be set to `false`. Therefore, we recommend creating a script with the following logic:

* if `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`, use the token generated via `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call to authenticate your users.
* if the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `false`, use the token generated via  `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call to authenticate your users.
+
This ensures a smooth transition between the two endpoints that will automatically adjust when ThoughtSpot Support changes the flag for you.

While we strongly recommend using a script to dynamically adjust the endpoint usage during the transition period, the following options are also available:

Option 1::

Use `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` until ThoughtSpot Support disables the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting.
+
If your security rules change frequently, you may consider choosing Option 1. This option ensures that no data previously accessible to a user remains available to them longer than necessary. However, note that your users will see `No Data` for a period of time.

+
Choosing option 1 results in the following behavior:

. As long as `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`: +
Your users will be logged in with the data security entitlements assigned to the JWT token generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint, or via the data security rules persisted on the `user` > `user_parameters` object.
. When `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `false`: +
Your users will see no data (assuming you secured your Worksheet/Model columns as described in xref:jwt-migration.adoc#_step_3_flag_columns_whose_data_will_be_secured_using_the_jwt_endpoint[Step 3]) until you switch to using the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint. Your instance should start using this endpoint soon after the flag setting is switched.

Option 2::

Use the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint after logging a Support request to disable the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting.

+
If your security rules do not change often, consider using Option 2. For example, if the security rules defined via tokens generated from `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call are the same as the rules that you plan to apply with tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`, you may start using the new endpoint.

+
Choosing option 2 results in the following behavior:

. As long as `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`:  +
Your users will be logged in with the data security rules previously persisted on the `user` > `user_parameters` object (as ThoughtSpot still honors the security rules applied via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full`).
. When `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `false`: +
Your users will now be logged in ThoughtSpot and assigned security entitlements via the JWT token generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call and persisted on `access_control_properties` of the `user` object.

=== Step 6: Switch your workflow to auth/token/custom endpoint

After the transition period and when ThoughtSpot confirms that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting is disabled on your instance, you can update your script and start using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint. For more information about this endpoint, see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions].
