:page-description: Steps for migrating your implementation to use custom token API workflow

The `user_parameters` property in `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` APIs is deprecated in 10.4.0.cl. ThoughtSpot does not recommend using these API endpoints for ABAC token generation. After your instance is upgraded to 10.4.0.cl or a later release version, use the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom</a>+++ API endpoint to xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[generate a token with custom filter rules and user properties].

If your current application environment is using the beta version of the ABAC, follow the steps described in this article to smoothly migrate your ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object`  API endpoint to the new `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API workflow. If you need additional help and assistance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.


== Feature rollout

To control the enablement and rollout of ABAC via tokens, ThoughtSpot provides the following feature flags:

* `jwTokenFeatureEnabled` +
Enabled by default on all ThoughtSpot instances running 9.12.5.cl and later. It controls the availability of the Beta version of the ABAC token workflow.
* `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` +
Disabled by default. It controls the availability of the ABAC token generation method via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint.
* `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` +
Enabled by default on all instances running 10.4.0.cl and later. It controls which API endpoint is used for JWT token generation on an instance. When set to `true`, the ABAC implementation with `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` API endpoint is explicitly chosen as the default JWT token method for the cluster, regardless of the status of the *mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled* flag.

== User properties

To avoid ambiguity during the migration, ThoughtSpot uses a different user parameter to store security rules and other user contexts defined via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint.

In the beta version of ABAC implementation with the V2.0 Get token APIs, security attributes are stored in the `user` > `user_parameters` object.

With the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API workflow and future implementation of ABAC, user information will be stored in the `user` > `access_control_properties` object as shown in this example:

== Migration steps

This document assumes that you are currently using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` to create a JWT token to log in your users, and are persisting security rules on your users in the *+user_parameters+* field of the user object.

=== Step 1: Verify the state of your ThoughtSpot instance

. Ensure that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `true` on your instance. To check the status of this flag, send a `GET` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/system/config-overrides` API endpoint.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your ThoughtSpot instance is running 10.3.0.cl or earlier version, you must ensure that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`. If this feature flag is not enabled on your instance, contact ThoughSpot Support before migrating your ABAC workflow.
====

. Verify that you are using  `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` to generate tokens for ABAC for your users.
. Verify that your users have persisted data security values. To check this, send a `POST` request body with the user IDs or names to the `POST /api/rest/2.0/users/search` API endpoint and verify the persist property settings under `user_parameters` in the API response.

=== Step 2: Enable the workflow with custom token API endpoint

Create a ThoughtSpot Support request to enable `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` feature flag on your instance. This will allow you to set up security by default on the Worksheets or Models that you want to use for JWT security entitlements.

=== Step 3: Flag columns whose data will be secured using the JWT endpoint.

Navigate to your Worksheets / Models and set `is_mandatory_token_filter` to `true` on columns that you wish to secure via `filter_rules` set for ABAC.

For more information about `filter_rules`, see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions]

=== Step 4: Familiarize with the custom token authentication endpoint

After migration or upgrade to ThoughtSpot 10.4.0.cl or later, you'll need to use the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint to apply security entitlements via JWT authentication tokens.

We recommend that you use the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">REST API v2 Playground</a>+++ to familiarize yourself with the new payload, send test requests to demo users. Note that your production users will still be authenticated and secure via the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint until you complete the migration steps.

=== Step 5: Create a script to migrate to the new endpoint

As long as the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `true`, the rules defined via tokens generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call are applied to user profiles.
To apply the rules defined via tokens generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call, the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag must be set to `false`.

Therefore, we recommend that you create a script with the following the logic:

* If `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`, use the token generated via `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call to authenticate your users.
* If the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `false`, use the token generated via  `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call to authenticate your users.

This ensures a smooth transition between the two endpoints that will automatically adjust when ThoughtSpot Support changes the flag for you.

While we strongly recommend using a script to dynamically adjust the endpoint usage during the transition period, the following options are also available:

Option 1::

Use `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` until ThoughtSpot Support disables the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting.
+
If your security rules change frequently, you may consider choosing Option 1. This option ensures that no data previously accessible to a user remains available to them longer than necessary. However, note that during this period, users will not have access to any data.

+
Choosing option 1 results in the following behavior:

. As long as `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`, your users will be logged in with the data security entitlements assigned to the JWT token generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint, or via the data security rules persisted on the `user` > `user_parameters` object.
. When `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `false`, your users will see no data (assuming you secured your Worksheet/Model columns as described in xref:jwt-migration.adoc#_step_3_flag_columns_whose_data_will_be_secured_using_the_jwt_endpoint[Step 3]) until you switch to using the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint. Your instance will start using this endpoint soon after the flag setting is switched.

Option 2::

Use the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint after logging a Support request to disable the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting.

+
If your security rules do not change often, for example, if the security rules defined via tokens generated from `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call are the same as the rules that you plan to apply with tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`, consider using Option 2.

+
Choosing option 2 results in the following behavior:

. As long as `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`:  +
Your users will be logged in with the data security rules previously persisted on the `user` > `user_parameters` object (as ThoughtSpot still honors the security rules applied via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full`).
. When `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `false`: +
Your users will now be logged in and assigned security entitlements based on the rules applied via JWT token generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call and persisted on `access_control_properties` of the `user` object.

=== Step 6: Switch your workflow to auth/token/custom endpoint

After the transition period and when ThoughtSpot confirms that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting is disabled on your instance, you can update your script and start using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint. For more information about this endpoint, see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions].
