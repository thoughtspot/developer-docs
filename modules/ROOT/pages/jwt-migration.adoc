:page-description: Steps for migrating your implementation to use custom token API workflow

If your application instance is upgraded to 10.4.0.cl or a later version, ThoughtSpot recommends using +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom</a>+++ API endpoint to xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[generate a JWT token with custom security rules] instead of former `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` API endpoints.

For new implementations of data security using JWT tokens, refer to the xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc[ABAC via tokens documentation] for guidance.

If your current application environment is using the beta version of ABAC, follow the steps described in this article to smoothly migrate your ABAC implementation from using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` API endpoint to using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`.


////
== Feature rollout

To control the enablement and rollout of the ABAC via tokens feature, ThoughtSpot provides the following configuration settings:

* `jwTokenFeatureEnabled` +
Enabled by default on all ThoughtSpot instances running 9.12.5.cl and later. It controls the availability of the beta version of the ABAC token workflow.
* `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` +
Disabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances. It controls the availability of the ABAC token generation method via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint.
* `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` +
Enabled by default on all instances running 10.5.0.cl and later. This setting governs which API endpoint is used for ABAC token generation. When set to `true`, the ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` API endpoint is explicitly chosen as the default JWT token method for the cluster, regardless of the status of the `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` flag.
////


== User properties

In the beta version of ABAC implementation with the V2.0 Get token APIs (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` and `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object`), security attributes are stored in the `user` > `user_parameters` object. To avoid ambiguity during the migration, ThoughtSpot uses a different user property to store security rules and other specifications defined via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint. For all ABAC implementation with the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API workflow, the user's security entitlement details are stored in the `user` > `access_control_properties` object as shown in this example:

        }
      }
    }
  }
]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If the `persist` attribute is set as `true` for the beta version of the JWT tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint, please set the `persist_option` parameter to `REPLACE` in your API request to `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` to replicate this behavior after migration. +

* On instances running 10.4.0.cl, the persist option for the tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint uses the `APPEND` value by default, which appends the new conditions instead of replacing the existing rules. To replace the persisted attributes, set `persist_option` to `RESET` in your POST API call to `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`, and then send another API request with `persist_option` set as `APPEND`.

* The JWT tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` do not support runtime sorting.  If there are any runtime sorting rules applied via JWT tokens generated from the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call, they will be ignored during migration.
====

== Migration steps

This document assumes that you are currently using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` to create a JWT token to log in your users and to apply persisting security rules for user sessions in the `user_parameters` property of the user object.

////
=== Step 1: Verify the JWT token generation settings on your instance

. Ensure that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `true` on your ThoughtSpot instance. To check the status of this flag, send a `GET` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/system/config-overrides` API endpoint.

+

  "config_override_info": {
    "honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint": {
      "category": "MAIN",
      "dataType": "BOOLEAN",
      "description": "Flag to enable honoring of JWT Token where from Beta Endpoint.",
      "current": false
    }
  }
}
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your ThoughtSpot instance is running 10.3.0.cl or earlier version, you must ensure that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`. If this feature flag is not enabled on your instance, contact ThoughSpot Support before attempting to migrate your ABAC API workflow.
====

. Verify that you are using `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` to generate tokens for ABAC for your users.
. Verify that your users have persisted data security values. To check this, send a `POST` request body with the user IDs or names to the `POST /api/rest/2.0/users/search` API endpoint and verify the persist property settings under `user_parameters` in the API response.

////

=== Step 1: Enable the API workflow for the custom token endpoint

Create a ThoughtSpot Support request and ask for assistance to migrate to the JWT GA API workflow (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`).

////
* A quick patch of your environment that adds the JWT flags to your instance.
* Enabling the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting to ensure that your current JWT setup is honored while you work on the migration steps.
* Setting the `mandatoryTokenFilterFeatureEnabled` attribute to `true` that allows you to set up security by default on the Worksheets or Models that you want to use for JWT security entitlements.
////

=== Step 2: Set flags for columns and apply security rules
Navigate to your Worksheets / Models and set `is_mandatory_token_filter` to `true` on columns you wish to secure via `filter_rules` set for ABAC.

For more information about `filter_rules`, see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions].

=== Step 3: Build API requests for the custom token endpoint
Using a ThoughtSpot development instance, you can enable the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint to test how to create new JWT token requests, as well as test the behavior for your application user.

We recommend using the +++<a href="{{navprefix}}/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fauthentication%2Fget-custom-access-token">REST API v2 Playground</a>+++ to familiarize yourself with the request payload and send test requests to demo users.

Note that an instance can only use either the JWT Beta API endpoint (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object`) or the JWT GA API endpoint (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`) to define security rules and thus avoid ambiguity.

=== Step 4: Switch your workflow to auth/token/custom endpoint

To schedule your migration, please contact ThoughtSpot Support. We will help you verify the functionality of the new GA API endpoint (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`) for your users and disable the JWT token generation workflow with beta endpoints (`/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` or `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/object` upon successful validation.

For more information about the API request and response workflow to the custom token endpoint (JWT GA API endpoint), see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions].

////
Before creating a script, check the status of the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag on your instance:

. Send a `GET` request to the `/api/rest/2.0/system/config-overrides` API endpoint.
The API returns the configuration override details in the response.
. Search for `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` and check its current state.

+
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "config_override_info": {
    "honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint": {
      "category": "MAIN",
      "dataType": "BOOLEAN",
      "description": "Flag to enable honoring of JWT Token where from Beta Endpoint.",
      "current": true
    }
  }
}
----

As long as the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `true`, the rules defined via tokens generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call are applied to user profiles.
To apply the rules defined via `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API endpoint, `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` must be set to `false`. Therefore, we recommend creating a script with the following logic:

* if `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`, use the token generated via `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call to authenticate your users.
* if the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` flag is set to `false`, use the token generated via  `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call to authenticate your users.
+
This ensures a smooth transition between the two endpoints that will automatically adjust when ThoughtSpot Support changes the flag for you.

While we strongly recommend using a script to dynamically adjust the endpoint usage during the transition period, the following options are also available:

Option 1::

Use `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` until ThoughtSpot Support disables the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting.
+
If your security rules change frequently, you may consider choosing Option 1. This option ensures that no data previously accessible to a user remains available to them longer than necessary. However, note that your users will see `No Data` for a period of time.

+
Choosing option 1 results in the following behavior:

. As long as `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`: +
Your users will be logged in with the data security entitlements assigned to the JWT token generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` endpoint, or via the data security rules persisted on the `user` > `user_parameters` object.
. When `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `false`: +
Your users will see no data (assuming you secured your Worksheet/Model columns as described in xref:jwt-migration.adoc#_step_3_flag_columns_whose_data_will_be_secured_using_the_jwt_endpoint[Step 3]) until you switch to using the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint. Your instance should start using this endpoint soon after the flag setting is switched.

Option 2::

Use the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint after logging a Support request to disable the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting.

+
If your security rules do not change often, consider using Option 2. For example, if the security rules defined via tokens generated from `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full` API call are the same as the rules that you plan to apply with tokens generated via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom`, you may start using the new endpoint.

+
Choosing option 2 results in the following behavior:

. As long as `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `true`:  +
Your users will be logged in with the data security rules previously persisted on the `user` > `user_parameters` object (as ThoughtSpot still honors the security rules applied via `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full`).
. When `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` is set to `false`: +
Your users will now be logged in ThoughtSpot and assigned security entitlements via the JWT token generated from the `POST /api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` API call and persisted on `access_control_properties` of the `user` object.

=== Step 6: Switch your workflow to auth/token/custom endpoint

After the transition period and when ThoughtSpot confirms that the `honorJwTokenParametersFromBetaEndpoint` setting is disabled on your instance, you can update your script and start using `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/custom` endpoint. For more information about this endpoint, see xref:authentication.adoc#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions[Get tokens with custom rules and filter conditions].
