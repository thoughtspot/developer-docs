:page-description: Get started with embedding ThoughtSpot component in your app.

ThoughtSpot provides Visual Embed SDK, a Javascript library to help you embed ThoughtSpot components  such as charts and tables, Liveboards, Search functionality, or the full ThoughtSpot experience in your app.

Let's get started with embedding a ThoughtSpot component in your application.

== Before you embed

Check if you have access to a ThoughtSpot instance. If you don't have a ThoughtSpot application instance, link:https://www.thoughtspot.com/trial?tsiref=web-devsite[sign up for a Free Trial, window=_blank].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must add your embedding application domain(s) to the xref:security-settings.adoc[CSP and CORS allowlist] on the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page in ThoughtSpot. To configure CORS and CSP settings, you need admin or developer privilege (*Has Developer privilege*).
====

== Create content in ThoughtSpot
Building content in ThoughtSpot for embedding is done through ThoughtSpot’s UI, following the same process for an internal business use case.

The basic sequence involves the following steps:

* Log in to your ThoughtSpot instance. +
* link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections[Connect your instance to a Data Warehouse, window=_blank]. +
If you’re using the Free Trial instance, note that it is already connected to a sample data warehouse.
* Create the objects required for embedding. For example, charts, tables, and Liveboard.

To learn more about data connections, data models and objects, and how to search data and create Liveboards, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/ts-cloud-getting-started[ThoughtSpot product documentation, window=_blank].

== Get started with embedding
This section provides a set of steps to quickly embed a xref:faqs.adoc#lbDef[Liveboard] from the link:https://www.thoughtspot.com/trial?tsiref=web-devsite[Free Trial, window=_blank] or your own ThoughtSpot application instance.
The following figure shows a sample Liveboard with charts and a table:

If you want to embed other ThoughtSpot components and explore the additional capabilities of the Visual Embed SDK, see the xref:getting-started.adoc[embedding components guide] or the resources listed in the xref:onboarding-guide.adoc#addResources[Explore more] section.

=== Step 1: Install the Visual Embed SDK

The latest version of the Visual Embed SDK is available at link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk, window=_blank].

[source,console]
----
npm install @thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk
----

=== Step 2: Import the SDK into your project

Import the SDK package into your application environment. Let's import the `LiveboardEmbed` SDK package to embed a Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----


[#initSdk]
=== Step 3: Initialize the SDK

To initialize the SDK, the following information is required:

* `thoughtSpotHost` +
The hostname of your ThoughtSpot application instance. For example, `team2.thoughtspot.cloud`. See xref:faqs.adoc#tsHostName[FAQs] to know how to find the hostname of your application instance.
* `authType` +
Authentication type. ThoughtSpot supports a variety of Authentication types. For testing purposes, you can use `AuthType.None`. For other authentication options, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

Ensure that you call `init` before `render()`.

=== Step 4: Add the component

Each embedding option requires you to define the properties of the component you want to embed. For example, to embed a Liveboard, you must specify the GUID of the Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});

const lb = new LiveboardEmbed('#container', {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardId: '22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5',
});

// Do not forget to call render.
lb.render();
----

The  `#container` in the above example is a selector for the DOM node which the code assumes is already attached to DOM. The SDK will render the ThoughtSpot component inside this container element.

[NOTE]
====
* If you don't know the GUID of Liveboard, open the Liveboard in the ThoughtSpot UI and copy the GUID from the URL. You can also use the Visual Embed Playground to view the GUID of the Liveboard.
* If you are a free trial user, use `22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5`.

React::
[source,TypeScript]
----
import { LiveboardEmbed } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/react';

const App = () => {
    const embedRef = useEmbedRef();
    const onLiveboardRendered = () => {
        embedRef.current.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [
            {
                columnName: 'item type',
                operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
                values: ['Jackets'],
            },
        ]);
    };
    return (
        <LiveboardEmbed
            ref={embedRef}
            liveboardId="22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5"
            onLiveboardRendered={onLiveboardRendered}
        />
    );
};
----

For more information about events, see xref:HostEvent.adoc[HostEvent] and xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[EmbedEvent].


=== Step 5: Verify the embedded object

Load the application page with the embedded object in your app.

The following figure shows an embedded view of the Liveboard object.
