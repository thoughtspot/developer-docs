:page-description: Get started with embedding thoughtSpot component in your app.

ThoughtSpot provides Visual Embed SDK, a Javascript library to help you embed ThoughtSpot components  such as charts and tables, Liveboards, Search functionality, or the full ThoughtSpot experience in your app.

Let's get started with embedding a ThoughtSpot component in your application.

== Before you begin

* Log in to your ThoughtSpot instance. +
If you don’t have access to a ThoughtSpot application instance, link:https://www.thoughtspot.com/trial?tsiref=web-devsite[sign up for a Free Trial, window=_blank].  +
* link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections[Connect your instance to a Data Warehouse, window=_blank]. +
If you’re using the Free Trial instance, don’t worry! We have already connected a sample data warehouse for you.
* Create the objects required for embedding. For example, charts, tables, and Liveboard.
* Add your embedding application domain to the xref:security-settings.adoc[CSP and CORS allowlist] on the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page in ThoughtSpot. To configure CORS and CSP settings, you need admin or developer privilege (*Has Developer privilege*).

== Get started with embedding

Embedding a ThoughtSpot component in your app is easy and requires only a few steps. ThoughtSpot supports several embed options such as Liveboard Embed, Natural Language Search Embed, Visualisation Embed, and Full Application Embed.

Let's embed a simple xref:faqs.adoc#lbDef[Liveboard] with charts and tables.

=== Step 1: Install the Visual Embed SDK

The latest version of the Visual Embed SDK is available at link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk, window=_blank].

[source,console]
----
npm install @thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk
----

=== Step 2: Import the SDK into your project

Import the SDK package into your application environment. Let's import the `LiveboardEmbed` SDK package to embed a Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----


[#initSdk]
=== Step 3: Initialize the SDK

To initialize the SDK, the following information is required:

* `thoughtSpotHost` +
The hostname of your ThoughtSpot application instance. For example, `team2.thoughtspot.cloud`. See xref:faqs.adoc#tsHostName[FAQs] to know how to find the hostname of your application instance.
* `authType` +
Authentication type. ThoughtSpot supports a variety of Authentication types. For testing purposes, you can use `AuthType.None`. For other authentication options, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

=== Step 4: Add the component

Each embedding option requires you to define the properties of the component you want to embed. For example, to embed a Liveboard, you must specify the GUID of the Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
} from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});

const lb = new LiveboardEmbed('#container', {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardId: '22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5',
});

// Do not forget to call render.
lb.render();
----

The  `#container` in the above example is a selector for the DOM node which the code assumes is already attached to DOM. The SDK will render the ThoughtSpot component inside this container element.

[NOTE]
====
* If you don't know the GUID of Liveboard, open the Liveboard in the ThoughtSpot UI and copy the GUID from the URL. You can also use the Visual Embed Playground to view the GUID of the Liveboard.
* If you are a free trial user, use `22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5`.

React::
[source,TypeScript]
----
import { LiveboardEmbed } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/react';

const App = () => {
    const embedRef = useEmbedRef();
    const onLiveboardRendered = () => {
        embedRef.current.trigger(HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters, [
            {
                columnName: 'item type',
                operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
                values: ['Jackets'],
            },
        ]);
    };
    return (
        <LiveboardEmbed
            ref={embedRef}
            liveboardId="22e79c21-eec4-40bf-997b-7454c6e3a2a5"
            onLiveboardRendered={onLiveboardRendered}
        />
    );
};
----

For more information about events, see xref:HostEvent.adoc[HostEvent] and xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[EmbedEvent].

=== Step 5: Verify the embedded object

Load the application page with the embedded object in your app.

The following figure shows an embedded view of the Liveboard object.

== Explore more

Now that you’re ready with a basic embed, explore the additional capabilities that would provide you more control over your embedded application.

* Leverage the power of Natural Language Search with xref:embed-nls.adoc[ThoughtSpot’s Sage Embed].
* Explore the other embedding options available with the SDK:
** xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Visualization (a chart or table from a Liveboard)]
** xref:full-embed.adoc[Full ThoughtSpot experience]
** xref:embed-search.adoc[Search page]
** xref:embed-searchbar.adoc[Search bar]
** xref:embed-ts-react-app.adoc[React components]
* Create a xref:custom-actions.adoc[custom action] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[assign it to an embedded Liveboard or Answer page] generated from a search query.
* Control the xref:embed-actions.adoc[visibility of menu actions on the embedded page].
* xref:embed-events.adoc[Register events] that your app can listen to and respond with appropriate actions. +
Create custom workflows using xref:HostEvent.adoc[Host Events].
* Whitelabel and customize your ThoughtSpot embedded experience using xref:style-customization.adoc[style customization framework] and xref:css-customization.adoc[custom CSS].
* Explore the SDK and test your embedding in the xref:https://codesandbox.io/s/big-tse-react-demo-i4g9xi[Code sandbox].
