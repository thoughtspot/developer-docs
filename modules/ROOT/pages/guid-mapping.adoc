:page-description: Deploying TML involves GUID mapping, handled automatically by the deploy API

The xref:git-rest-api-guide.adoc#deploy-commits[deploy API endpoint] automatically generates and maintains a GUID mapping file in the xref:git-configuration[`config` Git branch] that records the GUID of the objects deployed from a Source Org (dev) to a Destination Org.

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot never alters any GUIDs in the files stored in Git, regardless of branch. The find/replace of the mapping process occurs as the TML files in Git are imported by the *Deploy* REST API.
====

You can use the Git APIs across distinct ThoughtSpot instances, as long as they are configured to the same Git repository. 

The GUID mapping files will be maintained as described below, but the GUIDs may be identical if both instances do not have Orgs enabled, because ThoughtSpot will use a provided GUID in a TML file during object creation if that GUID does not exist already *on that instance*. 

== GUID mapping files
Each Org configured for Git integration will have a mapping JSON file generated with the name pattern `org-{orgId}.json` in the Git branch selected to host configuration files during the Git setup.

The mapping files for each ThoughtSpot *instance* will live in a directory in the `config` branch with name pattern `{instanceId}.mapping`. The `instanceId` is the `id` property returned from the REST API link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fsystem%2Fget-system-information[`/system`] call.

Each mapping JSON file is an array of mapping objects recording the GUIDs for each TML object, which are automatically generated and maintained during each *deploy* API call:

* `originalGuid` refers to the GUID of the object on the source environment, typically the `dev` environment
* `mappedGuid` refers to the GUID of the object on the destination environment, for example, `release` or `prod`
* `counter` shows the number of times the mapped object was used in deploy operations.
* `additionalMapping` is an object with direct key-value mappings of `viz_ids` on a Liveboard, and is otherwise an empty object `{}`

The following figure illustrates how GUIDs are mapped during deployments:

== How mapping works
The mapping file is updated when a new object is first created in the destination Org and receives its automatically generated GUID from the ThoughtSpot instance.

Mapping itself is performed with an *exact string find/replace* operation, on the TML objects *directly prior to import*, without modifying the files in Git.

=== Using mapping for Table TML properties
There are several properties within Table TML files related to a table's fully qualified name (FQN) within the RDBMS, that often need to be changed between Orgs.

You can use the *exact string find/replace* nature of the GUID Mapping file to define changes in the Table TMLs between environments.

Add the properties to the mapping file, including the TML property key along with the value, as shown here:

[source,JSON]
----
[
{
  "originalGuid" : "db: DEVDBNAME",
  "mappedGuid" : "db: PRODDBNAME",
  "counter" : 0,
  "additionalMapping" : { }
},
{
  "originalGuid" : "schema: DEV_SCHEMA",
  "mappedGuid" : "schema: CUSTOMER_A_SCHEMA",
  "counter" : 0,
  "additionalMapping" : { }
}
]
----

Note that the results will be an exact match on the provided string with exact string find/replace across the full set of TML deployed to that Org via Git.

If you need to limit the find/replace to a specific TML file, you can instead put the rule within the `additionalMapping` section of the file:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "originalGuid" : "cb04e13a-7969-42d5-9469-c3beb5182af6",
  "mappedGuid" : "91864ed5-63c2-4c9d-8d20-ba9a1e77a888",
  "counter" : 1,
  "additionalMapping" : {
    "db: DEVDBNAME" : "db: PRODDBNAME",
    "schema: DEV_SCHEMA" : "schema: CUSTOMER_A_SCHEMA"
  }
}
----

This requires more effort but will work if there is a situation where a single find/replace against all files would result in incorrect results. 

Given there are often many Table TML files being redeployed, perhaps across different connections, the additional specificity may be necessary.

[#connection_variations]
=== Connection variations in each Org
link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections[Connections] contain the majority of details that vary between data environments, other than the `db` and `schema` properties within the table objects.

Connections can be defined programmatically via link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/restV2-playground?apiResourceId=http%2Fapi-endpoints%2Fconnections%2Fcreate-connection[REST API, target=_blank] or using link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml-connections[TML for connections, target=_blank], as well as in the ThoughtSpot UI.

Creating a connection involves secure credentials, which will never be exported in the Connection TML. For this reason, it is preferable to set via UI or REST API at this time. An example of creating connections via REST API across multiple orgs link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_rest_api_v1_python/blob/main/examples_v2/create_connection_on_orgs.py[is available here, target=_blank].  

== Switching "dev" Orgs
When Orgs is first enabled on an instance, all existing content will continue to exist in what is now termed the *Primary* Org, which will have `org_id` of `0`. 

While the best practice recommendation is to have a separate *dev Org* and *prod Org* from the *Primary Org*, you may want to continue with using the *Primary Org* as *prod* for the time being, while copying content over to the *dev Org* to being doing controlled SDLC processes.

You can accomplish this in phases using the Git APIs:

1. Create a *temporary Git branch* and xref:git-configuration.adoc#update-git-config[update the configuration] the *Primary/prod Org* with this branch to make it available to the Commit API
2. Use the xref:git-rest-api-guide.adoc#commit-files[Commit API] to export all desired objects from the *Primary/prod Org* into the temporary Git branch (not the xref:git-configuration.adoc#configuration-options[commit branch] that you will use for deployment *to* the prod Org)
3. Use the xref:git-rest-api-guide.adoc#deploy-commits[Deploy API] into the new *dev Org* from the temporary branch to bring all of the content into the *dev Org*. This will create the *GUID Mapping File* for the *dev Org*
4. Take the JSON structure of the GUID Mapping file from the *dev Org*, copy it, and *swap the keys and values*, then save the result in the GUID Mapping file of the *prod Org*

=== Swapping the keys and values in GUID Mapping file
The structure of the GUID Mapping file is entirely simple key-value mappings in JSON, and thus can be easily swapped around programmatically.

It is okay to modify the files in the `config_branch` manually, to make additions or corrections, as long as you keep everything in the proper format matching what ThoughtSpot generates.

An example of this process in Python is available as link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_rest_api_v1_python/blob/main/examples_v2/git_guid_mapping_file_functions.py[git_guid_mapping_file_functions.py, target=_blank].

Simply take the swapped JSON and save it in `org-0.json` file within the `{instanceId}.mapping` directory of the `config_branch` in GitHub.

Now you can being to use pull requests to move content from the `dev branch` to the `prod branch`, and when you do the Deploy API, the GUIDs will be swapped properly from their new origin in `dev Org` to the values in prod.
