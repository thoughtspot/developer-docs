:page-description: You can use the LiveboardEmbed SDK library to embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard in your app and use it for live insights

This page explains how to embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard in your Web page, portal, or application.

== Overview

A ThoughtSpot Liveboard is an interactive dashboard that presents a collection of visualizations pinned by a user. ThoughtSpot Liveboards are available the following modes:

* Classic experience mode
* New experience mode
+
The new Liveboard experience can be turned off or on using the `liveboardV2` parameter in the `LiveboardEmbed` SDK.

==== Liveboard layout in embedded mode
In the new Liveboard experience mode, the embedded Liveboard resizes to one-column layout if the screen width is 1024px or less. In classic experience mode, the embedded Liveboard adjusts its layout to two-column or one-column view to fit the screen width and orientation of the user's device.

== Import the LiveboardEmbed package

Import the `LiveboardEmbed` SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
    EmbedEvent
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,JavaScript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        LiveboardEmbed,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

xref:getting-started.adoc#initSdk[Initialize the SDK] and define authentication attributes.

== Create an instance of the LiveboardEmbed class

[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    disabledActions: [],
    fullHeight: true,
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>',
    hiddenActions: [],
    liveboardId: '<%=liveboardGUID%>',
    visibleVizs: [],
    runtimeFilters: [],
});
----
////
[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    additionalFlags: {
    <key>: <value>
    },
    disabledActions: [],
    fullHeight: true,
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>',
    hiddenActions: [],
    liveboardId: '<%=liveboardGUID%>',
    enableVizTransformations: true,
    preventLiveboardFilterRemoval: true,
    runtimeFilters: [],
});
----

////
frameParams::
Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the Liveboard object. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage.

----
////


fullHeight __Optional__::
_Boolean_. Dynamically resizes the embedded Liveboard frame according to the height of the Liveboard.

+
If the embedded Liveboard does not fit vertically within your application page, a second scroll bar may appear. When `fullHeight` is set to `true`, the embedded Liveboard frame is automatically adjusted according to the height of the Liveboard, and the second scroll bar does not appear.

defaultHeight::
_Integer_. Minimum height to set for embedded objects on a Liveboard page and the corresponding visualization pages that a user can navigate to from the Liveboard page. The default value is `500` pixels.

++++


visibleActions __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Displays the specified actions on the *Liveboards* page. These actions can appear as buttons, or as menu actions in **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] or the contextual menu. You can use this attribute to show a small subset of actions from the list of available actions.

+
----
visibleActions: [Action.DownloadAsPDF,Action.DownloadAsCSV,Action.Save,Action.Present]
----

<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/liveboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

+
[NOTE]
====
Use either `visibleActions` or `hiddenActions` to show or hide the actions in the embedded UI. For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Show or hide UI actions].
====

hiddenActions __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Hides specified actions from the list of available actions on the embedded *Liveboards* page. You can use this attribute to remove the actions that are not relevant to your application context. Do not use this attribute if `visibleActions` are defined.

+
For example, to hide *Add filters* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify `Action.AddFilter` in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
----
hiddenActions: [Action.AddFilter]
----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/liveboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++


disabledActions __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Disables the specified actions. You can use this attribute to restrict user access to certain features.
+
For example, to disable the *Present* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify `Action.Present` in the `disabledActions` attribute.

+
----
disabledActions: [Action.Present]

include::{path}/custom-action-note.adoc[]

disabledActionReason __Optional__::
_String_. The text to show for disabled actions. The text string specified in `disabledActionReason` shows as a tooltip when a user hovers over a disabled action in the embedded UI. For example, if you have disabled the `Download` action and you intend to enable this action for only authorized users, you can specify `disabledActionReason` as `Contact your administrator to enable this feature`.

liveboardId::
_String_. The GUID of the Liveboard.

liveboardV2 __Optional__::
__Boolean__. Use this parameter to turn on or off the xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc[new Liveboard experience]. By default, the `liveboardV2` attribute is set to `false`.

////
enableVizTransformations __Optional__::
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, it displays the contextual menu for visualizations. The contextual menu allows users to drill down a visualization, apply filters, and view detailed insights.

////

[#filter-removal]
preventLiveboardFilterRemoval __Optional__::
_Boolean_. When set to true, it disables the filter removal action and thus prevents users from removing the filters applied to a Liveboard visualization.

visibleVizs __Optional__::
_Array of strings_. Allows adding GUIDs of the visualizations, which you want to show by default on an embedded Liveboard when it renders for the first time.
+
You can show or hide the visualizations by triggering the `SetVisibleVizs` event.

runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to apply when the pinboard page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to filter data at the time of retrieval. Runtime filters allow you to apply a filter to a visualization in a pinboard by passing filter specifications as URL query parameters.
+
Runtime filters do not appear to the user in the Liveboard UI. They do not adjust the values of visible Liveboard filters, but act as an additional set of filters â€” both runtime filters and UI filters will be applied within the queries.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a Liveboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
    columnName: 'Region',
    operator: RuntimeFilterOp.IN,
    values: ['Midwest', 'East', 'West']
}]
----

columnName;;
__String__. Name of the column to filter by.

operator;;
__String__. The runtime filter operator. For more information about the runtime filter operators, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc#runtimeFilterOp[Runtime filters].

values;;
__String, Integer, or Boolean__. The list of operands. Operators like EQ, LE accept a single operand, whereas other operators like BW and IN accept multiple operands.

== Register, handle, and trigger events

Register event listeners.

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
----

For more information, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Interact with events].

== Render the embedded Liveboard

Render the embedded Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.render();
----

== Test the embedded workflow

* Load the client application.
* Try accessing a Liveboard embedded in your application.
* Verify if the embedded content renders correctly on your application page.
* If you have disabled an action, verify if the action appears as disabled on the *Liveboards* page.
* If runtime filters are configured, verify if the filters are applied to the visualizations on the Liveboard.

== Additional resources

* For code examples, see xref:code-samples.adoc[Code samples].
* For more information about the SDK APIs and attributes, see xref:sdk-reference.adoc[Visual Embed SDK Reference].
