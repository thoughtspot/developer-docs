:page-description: You can use the LiveboardEmbed SDK library to embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard in your app and use it for live insights

This page explains how to embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard in your Web page, portal, or application.

A ThoughtSpot Liveboard is an interactive dashboard that presents a collection of visualizations pinned by a user.

== Import the LiveboardEmbed package

Import the `LiveboardEmbed` SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    LiveboardEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
    EmbedEvent
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,JavaScript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        LiveboardEmbed,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

xref:getting-started.adoc#initSdk[Initialize the SDK] and define authentication attributes.

== Create an instance of the LiveboardEmbed class

[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardId: '<%=liveboardGUID%>',
});
----
For more information about the Liveboard embed object, classes, methods, interface properties, and enumeration members, see the following pages:

* xref:LiveboardEmbed.adoc[LiveboardEmbed]
* xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc[LiveboardViewConfig]
* xref:Action.adoc[Actions]

== Customize Liveboard view

The `LiveboardEmbed` component includes the `xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc[LiveboardViewConfig]` object. This object provides various attributes and properties to customize the xref:css-customization.adoc[look and feel of the Liveboard page], xref:embed-actions.adoc[control the visibility of menu actions] and features, and xref:embed-events.adoc[manage interactions between the host and embedded app].

The most common customization is controlling the visibility of menu items in the embedded view by configuring the `disabledActions`, `hiddenActions`, and `visibleActions` properties with an array of xref:Action.adoc[Action] IDs. For information about the other frequently used properties, see xref:embed-pinboard.adoc#common-customizations[common customization options].

== Register, handle, and trigger events

Register event listeners.

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
liveboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
----

For more information about events, see the following pages:

* xref:HostEvent.adoc[HostEvent]
* xref:EmbedEvent.adoc[EmbedEvent]
* xref:embed-events.adoc[Events and app integration]

== Render the embedded Liveboard

Render the embedded Liveboard.

[source,JavaScript]
----
liveboardEmbed.render();
----

== Verify the embedded object
. Load the embedded object in your app. If the embedding is successful, you will see a Liveboard page with visualizations.
+
[.bordered]
image::./images/embed-lb.png[Liveboard embed]

. Explore the charts and tables, and verify if objects render and show the desired data.

[#common-customizations]
== Common customization options
The *xref:LiveboardViewConfig.adoc[LiveboardViewConfig]*  object includes several properties and attributes that allow fine-grained control of the embedded experience. You can specify settings that enable or disable a specific feature, control visible or disabled menu elements and actions, set tabs and layout preferences, manage filters, hide header, and more.

=== Show/hide large UI elements
Parameters such as `hideLiveboardHeader`, `hideTabPanel`, `isLiveboardHeaderSticky`, `showLiveboardTitle`, and `showLiveboardDescription` control various aspects of the standard embedded Liveboard experience. Note the phrasing of the property name and the description in the documentation to understand whether `true` enables or disables the particular feature.

//Along with xref:Action.adoc[Actions], there is very fine-grained control of the display of the `LiveboardEmbed` component, which can vary for each user or content object displayed depending on the desires of the app development team.

[.widthAuto]
image::./images/liveboard_view_config_callouts_2.png[LiveboardViewConfig parameters]

The `hideLiveboardHeader` property removes the entire header area above the Liveboard, including filters and the overall Liveboard menu, which is a common pattern for "read-only' use cases or rebuilding your own menus and buttons using xref:embed-events.adoc[HostEvents].

The following constructor will disable the __sticky header__, while showing the Liveboard title, which would be hidden by default:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    isLiveboardHeaderSticky : false,
    showLiveboardTitle: true,
    liveboardId: '<%=liveboardGUID%>',
});
----

[NOTE]
====
When `fullHeight` is set to `true`, the SDK ignores the `isLiveboardHeaderSticky:true` setting, and the Liveboard header will not be sticky.
====

=== Customize Liveboard tabs

By default, the first tab created on a Liveboard is set as the home tab. You can set any tab as an active tab using the `activeTabId` property in the Visual Embed SDK as shown in the example here:

[source,JavaScript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardId: "d7a5a08e-a1f7-4850-aeb7-0764692855b8",
    activeTabId: "05406350-44ce-488e-abc5-5e8cdd65cf3c",
});
----

[NOTE]
====
The `activeTabId` property is available only in the `LiveboardEmbed` package and is not supported in the full application embed mode.
====

=== Reduce visible tabs and visualizations
`visibleVizs` and `visibleTabs` allow for limiting the experience for certain users from a Liveboard with many more elements.

For example, a template Liveboard with many different KPIs could be reduced down to a smaller set by giving a user an interface to select the particular visualizations to show, storing their selections, and using that saved set of visualization GUIDs as the array for `visibleVizs` on page load (there is an equivalent xref:embed-events.adoc[HostEvent] called `SetVisibleVizs` to make an update after the Liveboard has loaded).

[#noteTiles]
=== Add Note tiles
You can add a link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-notes[Liveboard Note tile, window=_blank] with custom text, images, and links on an embedded Liveboard.

* Only users with edit access to a Liveboard can add a Note tile.
* Users require `Can upload data` privilege to upload an image to the note tile.
* If you are adding links and images from an external site, or embedding multimedia or a web page in an iFrame, make sure the URLs are added to CORS and CSP allowlists. For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security settings].

=== Redefine Liveboard breakpoint widths
When turned on, the `enable2ColumnLayout` allows for customising the Liveboard breakpoint width for embedded users.
The current 12 column layout changes to 2 columns per row at 1024px, and to 1 column per row layout at 630px in the new Liveboard experience. Once enabled, these breakpoints would apply to all Liveboards in the ThoughtSpot instance, and cannot be set only for individual Liveboards.

These breakpoint widths are customisable for the embedded customers. Contact ThoughtSpot support for assistance with customisation.

[#lbv2]
== Liveboard experience
Starting from 10.1.0.cl, the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/deprecation#_removed_in_10_1_0_cl[classic experience for liveboards has been deprecated].

The new Liveboard experience provides an improved interface with several new features and enhancements. The following figure shows the menu actions available on a Liveboard page in the new experience:

[.bordered]
[.widthAuto]
image:./images/liveboard-exp.png[Liveboard experience comparison]


=== Features in New Experience mode

* Liveboard edit +
To edit a Liveboard in the new experience mode, click the *Edit* button on the Liveboard page. For example, to delete a visualization on a Liveboard, the user must click *Edit*, and then navigate to the *Delete* option on a visualization.

* Filter application in the new experience mode +
To apply filters, the application users must switch to the edit mode. Only users with edit access to the Liveboard can apply filters. When a user creates a copy of a Liveboard, the filters applied on its visualizations are also copied. For more information about Liveboard filters, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-filters[Liveboard filter configuration options, window=_blank].
* Actions +
The following actions are deprecated in the new experience mode:
** The *Copy embed link* and *Copy link* menu actions in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu of a Liveboard
** The edit title icon on visualization tiles
** The *Share* button on visualizations


=== Liveboard tabs

Liveboard tabs allow you to logically group visualization into specific categories and allow users to access them easily.

To create, edit, or move visualizations to a tab, you require edit access to a Liveboard.

* To add a tab, click *Edit* and then click *Add tab* on the Liveboard page.
* To add a visualization to a tab on a Liveboard, click *Move to tab* from the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
+
You can also pin a visualization to a Liveboard tab using the **Pin** action on the Answer page.
////

=== Customize filters

To view specific data across the tables and charts on an embedded Liveboard, users can use Liveboard filter options. You can embed a Liveboard with filters already applied or xref:runtime-filters.adoc[define runtime filters] in the Visual Embed SDK and apply filters during load time.

Embedding application users can also apply filters across visualizations using the link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-filters-cross[cross-filter feature, window=_blank].

The Visual Embed SDK provides the following host events to trigger an action to get or update filters:

* link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_HostEvent#_getfilters[`HostEvent.GetFilters`]
* link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_HostEvent#_updatefilters[`HostEvent.UpdateFilters`]
* link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_HostEvent#_updateruntimefilters[`HostEvent.UpdateRuntimeFilters`]
* link:https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/Enumeration_HostEvent#_updatecrossfilter[`HostEvent.UpdateCrossFilter`]

==== Date filters

For `DATE` and `DATE_TIME` data types, you must provide the date and time values in the Epoch time format when xref:runtime-filters.adoc#_apply_runtime_filters_on_embedded_objects[applying or updating runtime filters] via SDK or REST API.

However, when updating filters using `HostEvent.UpdateFilters`, you must include the date filter `type` along with the time period to apply any rolling or fixed time windows.

[NOTE]
====
* For `PERIOD` filters, you must include the `datePeriod` attribute in the date filter object.
* To specify the exact date, date range, you can use the date format such as `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`. If using epoch format, ensure that they are specified as numbers and not as strings. For example, `[1743465599, 1754006399]`.

=== Liveboard grouping and styling [earlyAccess eaBackground]#Early Access#
You can now create a visual group of Answers and note tiles together in the Liveboard. You can select multiple Answers and notes in the Liveboard editor. You can also style parts of the Liveboard, groups and Answers with the new styling panel.
To enable this feature, set `isLiveboardStylingAndGroupingEnabled` to `true`. It is important to note the following changes which happen in the Liveboard UI and layout when this feature is active.

* All tiles on the Liveboard will now have a default border and an increased border-radius, resulting in more pronounced curved corners. This is part of the broader visualization tile customization options done to enhance the visual appearance of charts and tables.
* For Note tiles, the default scrollbar is now hidden for long content. Users must scroll within the tile area itself, and if the tile is not sized appropriately for its content, it may appear clipped due to the new container styles. This change emphasizes the importance of properly sizing Note tiles to avoid content being visually cut off.
* If a Liveboard is saved with Groups in the ThoughtSpot interface, but the embedding code does not have the grouping and styling feature enabled, the Liveboard will fail to load and throw an error. To embed a Liveboard that uses Groups, you must set `isLiveboardStylingAndGroupingEnabled` to `true` in your embedding configuration. This is required for compatibility with the new grouping and styling features; otherwise, the embedded Liveboard will not render correctly.

To understand about the CSS variables for this feature, see xref:customize-css-styles.adoc#grp-style[CSS variables reference].

=== Liveboard comments

ThoughtSpot does not support adding comments, replying, or subscribing to comment threads on embedded Liveboards.

//if the Liveboard is embedded in another application, the comment icon will not be visible to the embedded application users regardless of their access privileges.
