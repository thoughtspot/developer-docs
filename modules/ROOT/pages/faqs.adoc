The REST API v2.0 framework is built upon the existing core API functionality and data models but offers several new features and enhancements. It simplifies the request and response workflow and provides an enhanced developer experience with an interactive Playground.

For more information, see xref:rest-api-v2.adoc[REST API v2.0] and xref:rest-api-v1v2-comparison.adoc[REST API v1 and v2.0 comparison].
====

.Can I embed ThoughtSpot components using the REST API?

[%collapsible]
====
ThoughtSpot REST API framework supports data APIs, using which you can embed an Answer, Liveboard, or a specific visualization from a Liveboard. You can use these APIs with or without the Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot content in your app.

For more information, see the following pages:

* xref:embed-rest-api.adoc[Embed using REST APIs]
* xref:custom-viz-rest-api.adoc[Create a custom visualization using REST APIs]
====

.Are there any Certificate requirements for REST API calls

[%collapsible]
====
To communicate and exchange data with a ThoughtSpot application server securely via HTTPS:

* Your ThoughtSpot application instance must have SSL configured. +
+
If the REST API endpoint uses a certificate that's registered with an internal certificate registry, your REST API request via tools like Postman returns an SSL error. For production environments, ThoughtSpot recommends using HTTPS with valid SSL certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). If your application instance doesn't have a trusted certificate issued by a CA, contact your security administrator.

* Your REST client must have access to the server certificate in the Keystore or Truststore on your client environment.
+
One of the common causes for certificate errors during a REST API operation is the non-availability of trusted SSL certificates in the Keystore or Truststore in your client environment.
+
You can choose to skip the SSL certificate verification step in development or test environments. However, in production environments, use SSL verification checks to ensure that your REST client uses trusted server certificates when calling a REST API.
+
If you don't have the server certificate in your client environment, you can xref:about-rest-apis.adoc#_export_ssl_certificate_from_a_thoughtspot_cluster[export the SSL certificate from your ThoughtSpot cluster] and xref:about-rest-apis.adoc#_import_server_certificate_into_the_keystoretruststore[import it into your client application framework].
[discrete]
=== Export SSL certificate from a ThoughtSpot cluster
You can export an SSL certificate or certificate chain via Web browsers. For example, on Chrome, you can perform the following steps to export the SSL certificate:

. Open your ThoughtSpot application in a web browser.
. Click the padlock icon in the address bar.
. Click *Connection is secure* > *Certificate is valid*.
+
The Certificate viewer opens.
. Navigate to the *Details* tab to view the certificates.
. Select the certificates in the certificate hierarchy.
+
If your application requires a certificate chain that contains a sequence of certificates, select the root certificate.
. Download and save the certificate in the *Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)* format.
[discrete]
=== Import server certificate into the Keystore/TrustStore

You must add the SSL certificates obtained from your ThoughtSpot instance to Truststore or Keystore on your client environment. The steps to import a certificate vary based on your client's application framework. For example, in a JDK-based implementation, the trusted certificates and required keys are stored in the Java Keystore of your client application. In a Python-based implementation, the SSL certificates must be available in the certificate store used by Python.

* For a Java-based client, refer to the instructions at link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/security/toolsign/rstep2.html[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/security/toolsign/rstep2.html, window=_blank].

* For Python clients, see link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html[https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html, window=_blank].
