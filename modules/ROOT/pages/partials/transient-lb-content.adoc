To download or retrieve a Liveboard with unsaved changes, pass the `transient_pinboard_content` script with `getExportRequestForCurrentPinboard` method in the browser fetch request.

[source,JavaScript]
----
function getExportRequestForCurrentPinboard(frame: HTMLIframeElement): Promise<string>;
----

The promise returned resolves to a string that contains the transient Liveboard content, which is encoded as JSON and is sent to the Liveboard API endpoint with the transient content key. This content resembles the current Liveboard as is, including the unsaved changes if any, including unsaved changes to the following:

* Liveboard filters
* Runtime filters applied on visualizations on a Liveboard
* Liveboard layout

If the new Liveboard experience is enabled, the transient content includes ad hoc changes to visualizations such as sorting, toggling of legends, and data drill down.
