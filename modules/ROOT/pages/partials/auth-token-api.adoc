If you have enabled xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[trusted authentication] on ThoughtSpot and have access to the `secret key`, you can send an API request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint and get a login token for a ThoughtSpot user.

After you get the authentication token from ThoughtSpot via a REST API call to the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint, use this token in your API request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint to authenticate and log in a user.

==== Just-in-time provisioning and dynamic group assignment

Starting from 8.9.0.cl, the `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` API endpoint supports adding a user Just-in-Time (JIT) and dynamically assigning groups and privileges. If a user for whom you want to request an authentication token doesn't exist in the ThoughtSpot system, you can set the `autocreate` and `groups` properties in the API call to add the user and assign groups.

==== Request parameters

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
[options='header']
|====
|Form parameter|Description
|`secret_key`|__String__. The secret key string provided by the ThoughtSpot application server. ThoughtSpot generates this secret key when you enable trusted authentication on an application instance.
|`username` a|__String__. The username of the user configured in ThoughtSpot. +

If the user doesn't exist in the ThoughtSpot system, you can set the `autocreate` flag to `true` to create a user account in ThoughtSpot.

|`email` +
__Optional__ |__String__. Email address of the user. Specify a value for this parameter if provisioning a user just-in-time (JIT).
|`display_name` +
__Optional__ |__String__. Display name of the user. Specify a value for this parameter if adding a user just-in-time (JIT).

|`access_level` a|__String__. User access privilege. Valid values are: +

* `FULL` - Creates a session with full access.
* `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` - Allows view access to the visualization or Liveboard.
|`id` + |__String__. GUID of the ThoughtSpot object. If you have set the `access_level` attribute to `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW`, specify the GUID of the Liveboard or visualization object.

|`orgid`  a|__Integer__. ID of the Org to which the user belongs. This parameter is required if your ThoughtSpot instance is set as a multi-tenant environment and logically partitioned into Orgs. +

* If the user exists in ThoughtSpot and no `orgid` is specified, the API returns the authentication token to log the user in to their last logged-in Org.
* If the user exists in ThoughtSpot but is not assigned to any Org, and `autocreate` is set to `true`, the user will be added to the specified Org.
* If the user doesn't exist in ThoughtSpot and `autocreate` is set to `true`, the user is created and added to the specified Org ID.
* If the user already exists in the ThoughtSpot system, and the user does not belong to the specified `orgid`, the API returns an error.

[NOTE]
====
Org IDs are integers that are created automatically when a cluster administrator creates an Org. To know the Org IDs of Orgs, send a `GET` request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/orgs` API endpoint. If you have cluster administrator privileges, you can use the `/tspublic/v1/org/search` endpoint to get a list of all Orgs available on your cluster.
====

|`groups` +
__Optional__ a|__String__. A JSON array of groups to which the user belongs. For example, `["sales", "marketing"]`. +

* If the user doesn't exist in ThoughtSpot and `autocreate` is set to `true`, the user is assigned to the specified groups.
* If the user already exists in the ThoughtSpot system and `autocreate` is set to `false`, the API ignores the values specified in the `groups` attribute.
* If the user already exists in the ThoughtSpot system and `autocreate` is set to `true`, the API updates the user object.
* If `autocreate` is set to `true` and the group names are not defined in the `groups` property, ThoughtSpot does not update the user object.

|`autocreate` +
__Optional__ a|__Boolean__. When set to `true`, if the specified `username` does not exist in the ThoughtSpot system, a new user is created without a password. By default, the `autocreate` property is set to `false`.
|`jwt_user_options` +
__Optional__ a| A map of JSON parameters to define security entitlement for a given user. Use this option if you plan to implement xref:abac-user-parameters.adoc[Attribute-Based Access Control].

==== Example response

If the API request is successful, ThoughtSpot returns an authentication token for the user.

[NOTE]
====
* If the username specified in the API request exists in the ThoughtSpot system, the API returns the token, else it returns the `user not found` error.
* If the user does not exist in ThoughtSpot and the `autocreate` property is set to `true`, the user is created. If `groups` and `orgid` attributes are defined, ThoughtSpot assigns the user to the specified groups and Org ID.
* If the user already exists in ThoughtSpot, `autocreate` is set to `true`, and the group names are defined in the `groups` attribute, the user will be added to the groups specified in the API request. Similarly, if you have specified the `orgid` with `autocreate` set to `true`, the user will be assigned to the specified Org.
* When `autocreate` is set to true, if the groups specified in the `groups` attribute do not exist in the specified Org ID, ThoughtSpot will create groups in the specified Org ID and assign the user to these groups.
* The authentication token returned by ThoughtSpot can be used to access only the Org specified in the API request. If the client must be logged in to another Org, you must send another API request to get an authentication token from ThoughtSpot.
