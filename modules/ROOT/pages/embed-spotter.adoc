:page-description: You can use the ConversationEmbed SDK library to embed Conversational analytics experience in your application.

ThoughtSpot supports Natural Language Search queries and AI-generated Answers. With ThoughtSpot Spotter, this experience is further enhanced to a full conversational interface that users can interact with, ask follow-up questions, and get insights.

Visual Embed SDK offers several options to seamlessly embed conversational analytics within your applications and customize the interface and experience as per your organization's branding guidelines.

To integrate Spotter capabilities into your application environment, the following components are available:

* `ConversationEmbed` +
Allows embedding the full Spotter interface with a conversation panel and body.
* `BodylessConversation` +
Allows integrating xref:spotter-in-custom-chatbot.adoc[Spotter capabilities into a chatbot].

Additionally, you can also use xref:spotter-apis.adoc[REST APIs to create a conversation session, ask follow-up questions, and generate Answers].

This article describes how to embed Spotter interface with conversation panel and body in your app.


[NOTE]
====
If you are embedding full ThoughtSpot experience in your app via `AppEmbed`, you must enable new home page experience and set the home page search bar mode to `aiAnswer` to view Spotter components. For more information, see xref:full-app-customize.adoc#_include_spotter_interface[Customize full application embedding].

=== Spotter components

The `ConversationEmbed` package adds the following components to your embedding application:

* A conversation panel and prompt button to interact with Spotter
* The *Datasource selector* to allow application users to select a data source for Spotter analysis.
* A *Preview data* that allows users to preview the data source used for Spotter analysis.
* A *Reset* button to reset chat.

After a conversation session is created, the interface shows the prompt panels, charts and tables, Spotter feedback widget, and menu actions to *Pin*, *Save*, *Modify*, or *Download* the result.

== Get started with embedding Spotter

Before you begin, check the following:

* Spotter is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance
* Your environment has Visual Embed SDK v1.33.1 or later version

=== Import the SDK package

Import the `ConversationEmbed` SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    ConversationEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,JavaScript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        ConversationEmbed,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch,
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/index.js';
----

=== Initialize the SDK

To initialize the SDK, the following information is required:

* `thoughtSpotHost` +
The hostname of your ThoughtSpot application instance. See xref:faqs.adoc#tsHostName[FAQs] to know how to find the hostname of your application instance.
* `authType` +
Authentication type. ThoughtSpot supports a variety of Authentication types. For testing purposes, you can use `AuthType.None`. For other authentication options, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

=== Create an instance of ConversationEmbed object

Create an instance of the `ConversationEmbed` object and specify the data source ID. Optionally, you can specify the search query string to generate a chart or table at load time.

[source,JavaScript]
----
const conversation = new ConversationEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    worksheetId: '<%=datasourceGUID%>',
    searchOptions: {
        searchQuery: 'sales by region',
    },
});
----

[source,JavaScript]
----
const conversation = new ConversationEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    worksheetId: '<%=datasourceGUID%>',
    searchOptions: {
        searchQuery: 'sales by region',
    },
});
----

* `disableSourceSelection` +
Disables data source selection panel for embed users when set to `true`.
* `hideSourceSelection` +
Hides data source selection panel when set to `true`
* `locale` +
Sets the xref:locale-setting.adoc[locale and language] for Spotter interface.

==== Customize style, icons, and text
To customize the look and feel of the Spotter page, you can use the `customizations` settings in the SDK. The `customizations` object allows you to add xref:customize-css-styles.adoc[custom CSS definitions], xref:customize-text-strings.adoc[text strings], and xref:customize-icons.adoc[icons].

===== Icon overrides
To override the default Spotter icon, xref:customize-icons.adoc#identifyIconId[locate the icon ID] and create an SVG file with the icon ID. The following example uses the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/alternate-spotter-icon.svg[alternate-spotter-icon.svg, window=_blank] file hosted on `\https://cdn.jsdeliver.net` to override the Spotter icon.

[source,JavaScript]
----
 init({
     //...
     customizations: {
         // rd-icon-spotter
         iconSpriteUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/alternate-spotter-icon.svg"
     }
 });
----

[NOTE]
====
When customizing icons, ensure that the hosting server is added to CSP allowlist on the *Develop* > *Security Settings* page. For more information, see xref:customize-icons.adoc#_update_allowlists_in_security_settings_page[Customize icons].
====

===== Text string customization
Similarly, you can replace the text strings on the Spotter interface as shown in this example:

----
 init({
     //...
     customizations: {
         content: {
             strings: {
                 "Spotter": "dataAnalyzer",
                 "Preview data": "View data",
                 "Edit": "Modify"
             }
         }
     }
 });
----

[#SpotterCSS]
===== CSS customization

There are several CSS variables available for customizing Spotter interface. You can customize the background color of the conversation and prompt panels, button elements, and the components of the charts generated by Spotter. For more information, see xref:customize-css-styles.adoc#_spotter_interface[Spotter interface customization].
