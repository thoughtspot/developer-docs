:page-description: You can use the SpotterEmbed SDK library to embed Conversational analytics experience in your application.

ThoughtSpot supports Natural Language Search queries and AI-generated Answers. With ThoughtSpot Spotter, this experience is further enhanced to a full conversational interface that users can interact with, ask follow-up questions, and get insights.

Visual Embed SDK offers several options to seamlessly embed conversational analytics within your applications and customize the interface and experience as per your organization's branding guidelines.

To integrate Spotter capabilities into your application environment, the following components and APIs are available:

* To embed the full Spotter interface with a conversation panel that allows natural language text strings, data source selection, and interactions with AI generated Answers, use the `ConversationEmbed` component. +
The ``ConversationEmbed` is deprecated and replaced with `SpotterEmbed` in Visual Embed SDK v1.38.0.
* To integrate Spotter Agent capabilities in a chatbot, use the `BodylessConversation` component. The `BodylessConversation` is deprecated and replaced with `SpotterAgentEmbed` in Visual Embed SDK v1.38.0.
* In addition to the SDK components, ThoughtSpot provides a set of xref:spotter-apis.adoc[REST APIs to create a conversation session, ask follow-up questions, and generate Answers].

This article describes how to embed the Spotter interface using the `SpotterEmbed` component. For information about how to integrate Spotter Agent capabilities without body in a chatbot, see xref:spotter-in-custom-chatbot.adoc[Integrate Spotter into your chatbot].

== Before you begin

Before you begin, check the following:

* Spotter is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance.
* You have access to the latest version of the Visual Embed SDK or at least v1.33.1.

== Import the SDK package

Import the `SpotterEmbed` SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,JavaScript]
----
import {
    SpotterEmbed,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,JavaScript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        SpotterEmbed,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch,
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/index.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

To initialize the SDK, the following information is required:

* `thoughtSpotHost` +
The hostname of your ThoughtSpot application instance. See xref:faqs.adoc#tsHostName[FAQs] to know how to find the hostname of your application instance.
* `authType` +
Authentication type. ThoughtSpot supports a variety of Authentication types. For testing purposes, you can use `AuthType.None`. For other authentication options, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: 'https://your-thoughtspot-host', // Replace with your ThoughtSpot application URL
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

== Create an instance of the SpotterEmbed object

Create an instance of the `SpotterEmbed` object and specify the data source ID. Optionally, you can specify the search query string to generate a chart or table at load time.

[source,JavaScript]
----
const conversation = new SpotterEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    worksheetId: '<%=datasourceGUID%>', // ID of the data source object to query data
    searchOptions: {
        searchQuery: 'sales by region', // Optional: initial search query string to pass on load
    },
});
----

[#configControls]
=== Optional configuration controls for embed view

The embed package for Spotter includes the additional configuration flags to customize the Spotter interface.

* `disableSourceSelection` +
Disables data source selection panel for embed users when set to `true`.
* `hideSourceSelection` +
Hides data source selection panel when set to `true`
* `locale` +
Sets the xref:locale-setting.adoc[locale and language] for Spotter interface.
* `showSpotterLimitations` +
Shows functional limitations of Spotter when set to `true`

The following code sample sets the locale to English (United Kingdom) and enables viewing Spotter feature limitations.

[source,JavaScript]
----
const conversation = new SpotterEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    worksheetId: '<%=datasourceGUID%>', // ID of the data source object to query data
    searchOptions: {
        searchQuery: 'sales by region', // Optional: initial search query string to pass on load
    },
    locale: 'en-GB',
    showSpotterLimitations: true,
});
----

== Customize your embed view
To customize your embedded Spotter views, the following options are available with the Visual Embed SDK:

* Control the xref:embed-spotter.adoc#spotterMenuActions[visibility of menu actions in the embedded view]
* xref:embed-spotter.adoc#_customize_styles_and_interface_elements[Customize styles and interface elements]
* xref:embed-spotter.adoc#_customize_app_interactions_with_events[Customize app interactions]

[#spotterMenuActions]
=== Customize menu actions and elements

The SDK provides action IDs to disable, show, or hide the following elements and menu actions via `disabledActions`, `visibleActions`, or `hiddenActions` array.

The following menu actions are available by default in the embedded Spotter interface:

* *Preview data* and *Reset* actions on the conversation panel
* Edit and delete icons on the prompt panel
* *Pin*, *Save*, *Download*, *Modify* on Spotter-generated Answers
* Spotter feedback widget and chart switcher icon on Spotter-generated Answers

The following example shows how to disable actions and menu elements using xref:embed-actions.adoc[`disabledActions`] array:

[source,JavaScript]
----
 // Show these actions
 visibleActions: [Action.Pin,Action.Save,Action.Edit,Action.PreviewDataSpotter,Action.ResetSpotterChat,Action.SpotterFeedback,Action.EditPreviousPrompt,Action.DeletePreviousPrompt],
 // Disable these actions
 disabledActions:[Action.PreviewDataSpotter,Action.Edit],
 disabledActionReason: "Contact your administrator to enable this feature"
----

For a complete list of supported actions, see xref:embed-action-ref.adoc#_spotter[Spotter menu actions].

=== Customize styles and interface elements
To customize the look and feel of the Spotter interface, use the xref:css-customization.adoc[CSS customization framework] in the SDK. The `customizations` object allows you to add xref:customize-css-styles.adoc[custom CSS definitions], xref:customize-text-strings.adoc[text strings], and xref:customize-icons.adoc[icons].

==== Override icons
To override the icons, you must first identify the icon ID, create an SVG file to replace this icon, and add the SVG hosting URL to your embed customization code.

The most common icon ID to override is `rd-icon-spotter`, the default Spotter icon.

The following example uses the link:https://github.com/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/blob/main/alternate-spotter-icon.svg[alternate-spotter-icon.svg, window=_blank] file hosted on `\https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/` to override the Spotter icon.

[source,JavaScript]
----
 init({
     //...
     customizations: {
         // Specify the SVG hosting URL to overide the icon, for example Spotter (`rd-icon-spotter`) icon
         iconSpriteUrl: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thoughtspot/custom-css-demo/alternate-spotter-icon.svg"
     }
 });
----

[NOTE]
====
When customizing icons, ensure that the SVG hosting server is added to the CSP allowlist on the *Develop* > *Security Settings* page. For more information, see xref:customize-icons.adoc#_update_allowlists_in_security_settings_page[Customize icons].
====

==== Customize text strings
To replace text strings, you can use the `stringsIDs` and `strings` properties in the content customization object.

The following example shows how to replace "Spotter" and other text strings on the Spotter interface.

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Initialize the SDK with custom text string replacements
init({
    // ...
    customizations: {
        content: {
            // Use the strings object to replace the visible UI text with custom labels.
            strings: {
                // Change all instances of "Liveboard" to "Dashboard"
                "Liveboard": "Dashboard",
                // Change all instances of "Answer" to "Reports"
                "Answer": "Reports",
                // Change all instances of "Spotter" to "dataAnlyzer"
                "Spotter": "dataAnlyzer",
                // Change all instances of "Search" to "Analyze"
                "Search": "Analyze",
            }
        }
    }
});
----

[#SpotterCSS]
==== Customize styles

There are several CSS variables available for customizing Spotter interface. You can customize the background color of the conversation and prompt panels, button elements, and the components of the charts generated by Spotter.

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Initialize the SDK with CSS variables with custom style definitions
init({
  // ...
  customizations: {
    style: {
      // Use CSS variables to customize styles
      customCSS: {
        variables: {
          "--ts-var-button--primary-background": "#008000",
          "--ts-var-spotter-prompt-background": "#F0EBFF",
          "--ts-var-root-color": "#E3D9FC",
          "--ts-var-root-background": "#F7F5FF",
        },
      },
    },
  },
----

For more information about CSS variables for style customization, see xref:customize-css-styles.adoc#_spotter_interface[Spotter interface customization].

== Customize app interactions with events

To listen to the events emitted by the embedded ThoughtSpot component, register xref:embed-events.adoc#embed-events[embed event] handlers.

The following example shows how to register xref:EmbedEvent.adoc#_init[EmbedEvent.Init] and xref:EmbedEvent.adoc#_load[EmbedEvent.Load] listeners.

[source,JavaScript]
----
 conversation.on(EmbedEvent.Init, showLoader)
 conversation.on(EmbedEvent.Load, hideLoader)
----

Similarly, to trigger actions on the embedded ThoughtSpot interface, use xref:HostEvent.adoc[Host events].

== Render the embedded object

[source,JavaScript]
----
conversation.render();
----

== Code sample

[source,JavaScript]
----
import { SpotterEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';

// Initialize the SDK
init({
  thoughtSpotHost: 'https://your-thoughtspot-host', // Replace with your ThoughtSpot application URL
  authType: AuthType.None,
});

// Find the container element in your HTML
const container = document.getElementById('ts-embed');
if (container) {
  // Create and render the SpotterEmbed component
  const spotterEmbed = new SpotterEmbed(container, {
    worksheetId: 'your-worksheet-id', // ID of the data source object to query data
    searchOptions: {
      searchQuery: 'Sales by year', // Optional: initial search query string to pass on load
    },
    frameParams: {
      width: '100%',
      height: '600px',
    },
    // Add more configuration options as needed
  });

  spotterEmbed.render();
}
----
