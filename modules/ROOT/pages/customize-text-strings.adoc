:page-description: Customize text strings on ThoughtSpot application interface

You can customize text strings on the ThoughtSpot application interface using the `customizations` object in the SDK.

== Overview

When you customize text strings, all occurrences of the text across the ThoughtSpot UI are replaced. Therefore, check if the text string you want to customize appears on other pages of ThoughtSpot UI.

To customize all occurrences of the text string, use the `strings` property in the `customizations` object.

To replace a specific text string and avoid unintended changes, use the `stringIDs` property in the `customizations` object.

Note the following points:

* The text strings are case-sensitive.
* Customization of user-defined text strings such as object names, titles, or description text is not supported.
* When both `strings` and `stringIDs` properties are defined to override the same strings, the `stringIDs` definition will take precedence.

== Customize strings
To customize text strings, you can use the `strings` and `stringIDs` properties in the `customizations` object:

=== Override specific text strings using string IDs
To replace a specific occurrence of the text string, you need the string IDs.

. Locate the ID of the text string that you want to override:

.. Go to the *Visual Embed Playground*.
.. Select the embed type and object.
.. To find the string IDs, use the `exposeTranslationIDs` attribute as shown in this example:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
 additionalFlags: {
   exposeTranslationIDs: true,
 }
----
.. Click *Run*.
+
When the page is rendered, you'll see the string IDs enclosed in the angle brackets `< >`.
+

.. Note the IDs.

. Replace the string ID with your preferred text.
+
The following example shows how to replace the `Liveboard` and `Answer` text strings on the ThoughtSpot Home page using `stringIDs`:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
// Initialize the SDK with custom text string replacements
init({
    // ...
    customizations: {
        content: {
        // Use the stringIDs object to map the internal string IDs to the UI text and override the text with custom labels
        stringIDs: {
            // Change the label for "Answers" on the Home page type to "Reports"
            "Facet.objectType.answers": "Reports",
            // Change the label for "Liveboard" on the Home page to "Dashboards"
            "Facet.objectType.pinboards":"Dashboards",
            // Change `Spotter` prompt to "dataAnalyzer" on the Spotter page
            "convassist.spotter.askSpotter": "dataAnalyzer",
        },
    }
});

=== Override using a string ID map

If you have a JSON map of string IDs for all visible UI text, you can host it on a server and specify the URL in the `stringIDsUrl` property of the `customizations` interface. Ensure that the URL is added to the CSP allowlist on the *Develop* > *Security Settings* page.

[source,JavaScript]
----
init({
    // ...
    customizations: {
        content: {
            stringIDsUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/locales/en.json', // Replace with your string ID JSON hosting URL
        },
    },
});
----

=== Override text strings globally
To replace all occurrences of the text strings in the ThoughtSpot UI, define the string and substrings as shown in this example:

[source,JavaScript]
----
// Initialize the SDK with custom text string replacements
init({
    // ...
    customizations: {
        content: {
            // Use the strings object to replace the visible UI text with custom labels.
            strings: {
                // Change all instances of "Liveboard" to "Dashboard"
                "Liveboard": "Dashboard",
                // Change all instances of "Answer" to "Reports"
                "Answer": "Reports",
                // Change all instances of "Spotter" to "dataAnlyzer"
                "Spotter": "dataAnlyzer",
                // Change all instances of "Search" to "Analyze"
                "Search": "Analyze",
            }
        }
    }
});
----

If using the `strings` property in the `customizations` object to override text strings, note the following limitations and recommendations:

* Ensure that string and substring are defined in the correct order. +
For example, if the `Liveboard` text string is defined as `Dashboard`, all instances of `Liveboard` will be updated as `Dashboard` in the UI. If you want to customize `Pin to Liveboard` text string, you must specify the next substring as `Pin to Dashboard` instead of `Pin to Liveboard` as shown here.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
customizations: {
        content: {
            strings: {
              "Liveboard": "Dashboard",
              "Pin to Dashboard": "Save",
            }
        }
    }
----
+

However, if the `Pin to Liveboard` string precedes the `"Liveboard": "Dashboard"` string, specify the substring as `Pin to Liveboard` as shown in this example.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
customizations: {
        content: {
            strings: {
              "Pin to Liveboard": "Save",
              "Liveboard": "Dashboard",
            }
        }
    }
----

* When customize a text phrase, make sure to check if it contains strings that are already defined for overrides. For example, if you are replacing `Search` with `Analyze your data`, the `Search data` button in the UI will show as "Analyze your data data". In such cases, use the xref:customize-text-strings.adoc#_override_a_specific_instance_of_text_string_using_string_ids[string IDs] to replace strings systematically and avoid unintended overrides.



////
* Sometimes, you may need to break a text phrase or sentence into multiple substrings. If a text string contains a word or phrase, for example, `Liveboard`, which is already defined or must be defined as a separate substring, you can break the text string as shown in this example:

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
customizations: {
    content: {
      strings: {
        "Request access for this": "Get access to this",
        "Liveboard": "Dashboard"
      }
    }
  }

== Test your changes

Before making application-wide changes, try out string customization options in the +++<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/search" target="_blank">Visual Embed Playground</a>+++.

To view the code for customization:

. In the Playground, select the embed type.
. Select the *Apply custom styles* checkbox in the Playground. +
The `customizations` code for CSS modifications appears in the code panel.
. Add the text string customization code and verify the results.
