:page-description: Register a Webook to send KPI monitor alerts to an external application

ThoughtSpot users with administrator or developer privileges can register a Webhook to send Monitor alerts from a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) chart to an external application. KPI Monitor alerts notify users when a KPI metric meets a threshold condition or periodically as per the schedule configured by the user.

For example, you can create an alert to be notified when a Sales KPI exceeds a threshold of 200,000, or when
your weekly sales increase by 2%. By default, the email notifications are sent to the alert subscriber’s email address. With Webhooks, you can trigger alerts to the REST endpoint of an external application via HTTP POST requests and customize your application workflow to present these alerts as SMS messages or Slack notifications.

[NOTE]
====
The Webhooks feature is in Beta and is turned off by default. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

== Before you begin

* Make sure your ThoughtSpot user account has the privileges required to access the *Develop* page in the ThoughtSpot UI.
* Your destination application has a callback URL to accept HTTP POST requests.
* If you plan to use OAuth authentication, make sure you have the OAuth credentials and authorization URL of your application
* If you plan to use an API key for authentication, ensure that you have a valid API key.

== Configure Webhooks
To configure a Webhook and send alert data to the destination URL, complete the following steps:

* xref:webhooks.adoc#_register_a_webhook[Register a Webhook in ThoughtSpot]
* xref:webhooks.adoc#_assign_webhook_to_a_kpi_monitor_alert[Assign the registered Webhook to KPI Monitor alerts]

=== Register a Webhook

To register a Webhook in ThoughtSpot, complete the following steps:

. Go to image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] > **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Webhooks**.
. Click **Create Webhook**.
. In the ** Create Webhook** modal, specify the Webhook name and the URL of the destination application.
+
For testing purposes, you can use a URL from the link:https://webhook.site/[Webhook site, window=_blank].
. Specify the authentication type.
* No authentication +
Default authentication option. Not recommended for production environments.

* API Key +
Allows using an API key to authenticate API requests to the destination URL. Specify the API key to use in the `X-API-Key` request header.

* OAuthentication 2.0 +
Allows using OAuth credentials to authorize API requests. Specify client ID, client secret key, and authorization URL.
If the registered Webhook has Oauth authentication enabled, `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>` is sent in the request header.
. If the destination URL requires query parameters to be passed in the request URL, specify the parameters as key-value pairs.
. Click **Save**.

=== Assign Webhook to a KPI Monitor alert

To assign the registered Webhook to an alert:

* Go to a KPI chart and click the **Create alert** icon. +
If the alert is already configured, go to **Monitor** and click Edit alert to modify the alert properties.
* In the alert configuration modal, go to **Select notification channel** and select **Custom channel** and the Webhook.
* Ensure that alert type and subscription details are defined.
* Click **Save**. +
Based on the type of alert, the notification payload will be sent in JSON format to the Webhook URL via HTTP POST request.

The following example shows the notification payload:

----
WebhookNotification {
    enum SchemaVersion,
    enum EventSchemaType,
    enum NotificationType,
    User CurrentUser,
    DeletionWebhookNotification deletionWebhookNotification,
