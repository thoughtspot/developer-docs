:page-description: You can manage users and user groups using REST APIs

To provide access to ThoughtSpot content or define role-based privileges, you need to add users and groups in ThoughtSpot. You can create user accounts and user groups using REST API endpoints.

== User creation and update

You can create users using the xref:user-api.adoc#create-user[/tspublic/v1/user/] REST API endpoint and update user profiles via a xref:user-api.adoc#update-user[PUT call]. While you can xref:user-api.adoc#delete-user[delete users], it is preferable to xref:user-api.adoc#deactivate-user[deactivate the user] instead, which maintains the user's references within the system. 

When configuring xref:configure-saml.adoc[SAML SSO] in ThoughtSpot UI, you can select the *Automatically add SAML users to ThoughtSpot upon first authentication* option, which will use the values in the SAML assertion to create a user if they do not exist. ThoughtSpot can also add users to groups sent within the SAML assertion. To enable and configure the SAML groups capabilities, contact your ThoughtSpot team.

By default, ThoughtSpot sends e-mail messages to a new user and enables onboarding workflows when they first log in, even when you are embedding ThoughtSpot content. To alter this behavior at a system-wide level, you need to xref:customize-email-settings.adoc[Customize the onboarding settings]. The xref:user-api.adoc#update-user[update user REST API] also allows setting onboarding experience values for an individual user through the JSON object of the `content` argument. If you need to modify the default behavior beyond the available UI options, contact your ThoughtSpot team.

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot supports the local management of user profiles. For initial development and testing purposes, you can create users in ThoughtSpot and manage their profiles locally. However, in large production environments, avoid creating local user profiles to reduce the administration overhead.
====

=== User states
The user state describes the current state of a user account in a ThoughtSpot instance. At any given time, the user account can be in one of the following states:

* `ACTIVE`
+
Indicates that the user account is active and the user logged in to their ThoughtSpot instance with their credentials at least once.

* `INACTIVE`
+
Indicates that the user account is deactivated and does not have access to the ThoughtSpot instance. If required, administrators can re-activate such user accounts and reset password via a REST API call to the `/api/rest/2.0/users/activate` endpoint.

* `PENDING`
+
This state is used for IAMv2 users who have been sent a ThoughtSpot account activation email but have not logged in to their instance yet.

* `LOCKED`
+
Indicates that the user account is locked due to multiple incorrect login attempts. The account gets locked for an hour, after which the user can try to log in again.

* `EXPIRED`
+
This state indicates the user account has expired. For example, the free trial user accounts after the trial period expires.

* `SUSPENDED`
This state is used for IAMv2 users. The IAMv2 users do not require a password reset when transitioning between states such as `ACTIVE`, `EXPIRED`, or `INACTIVE`. It also supports seamless migration from IAMv1 to IAMv2 for embedded users. For more information, see xref:_authentication_with_iamv2[ Authentication with IAMv2].

=== Authentication with IAMv2

With IAMv2, users need to provide an email attribute for successful user creation. If no email is provided at the time of user creation, the admin email will be populated for that user.

==== Key features of the SUSPENDED user state

A few important features of the `SUSPENDED` state are:

* Users in the SUSPENDED state will not be able to log in to their ThoughtSpot instance. This provides an effective way to manage access without compromising security.
* Transitioning a user from SUSPENDED to ACTIVE or PENDING does not require a password reset.
* While creating or updating a user to the EXPIRED or INACTIVE state using REST APIs, the user will be suspended instead. This change will effectively block user logins without altering existing behavior.

==== Impacted API endpoints
The SUSPENDED state affects the following API endpoints:

* You can create a user in the SUSPENDED state using the create user REST API.
+
xref:user-api.adoc#create-user[`POST /tspublic/v1/user`] (Rest API v1)
+
xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc#_users[`POST /api/rest/2.0/users/create`] (Rest API v2)


* You can change the state of an ACTIVE or PENDING user to SUSPENDED or reactivate a SUSPENDED user to the ACTIVE or PENDING state using the update user REST API.
+
xref:user-api.adoc#update-user[`PUT /tspublic/v1/user/{userid}`] (Rest API v1)
+
xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc#_users[`POST /api/rest/2.0/users/{user_identifier}/update`] (Rest API v2)

==== Common user state transitions
Within the IAM v2 framework, the common user state transitions include:

* ACTIVE to EXPIRED
* ACTIVE to INACTIVE
* ACTIVE to SUSPENDED
* LOCKED to ACTIVE
* SUSPENDED to ACTIVE
* SUSPENDED to PENDING


////
There is also a *Unsuspend user* button on the *Users* dashboard of the *Admin* page. This button is available for all users in the SUSPENDED state.
The userâ€™s state will transition from SUSPENDED to ACTIVE or PENDING on clicking *Unsuspend user*.

== User group creation and update
Groups can be created via the xref:group-api.adoc#create-group[/tspublic/v1/group/] REST API endpoint. 

xref:api-user-management.adoc#group-privileges[Group privileges] are set directly on groups, either at group creation time, an xref:group-api.adoc#update-group[update call], or through the xref:group-api.adoc#add-privilege[add privilege] and xref:group-api.adoc#remove-privilege[remove privilege] methods.

== User association to groups
Users can can be added to specific groups when the user is being created, or you can use the xref:group-api.adoc#add-user-to-group[add a user to a group endpoint]. 

The xref:group-api.adoc#addMembers[group/addmemberships] endpoint allows adding multiple users to multiple groups in a single request.

The set of members within a group can be requested using the xref:group-api.adoc#get-users-group[/group/listuser/{groupid}] or xref:group-api.adoc#get-usersInGroup[/group/{groupid}/users] endpoints. 

You can remove a user from a group xref:group-api.adoc#delete-user-assoc[individually] or xref:group-api.adoc#removeMembers[remove a list of users] from many groups at once.

== Access control (sharing)
The content a user can access is determined by content *shared* directly to the user or the groups they belong to. It is easier to manage and audit sharing through groups rather than at the individual user level. 

Sharing can be accomplished through the UI or the xref:security-api.adoc#share-object[/security/share REST API endpoint], including removing sharing from a user or group.  

[#group-privileges]
== Group privileges

Each user group includes a set of privileges for its users. When a user is assigned to a group in ThoughtSpot, the default privileges associated with a group are assigned to its users. The group privileges allow users belonging to a group to perform specific operations and access workflows. If a user belongs to more than one group, they will have the highest level of privileges from all the groups they belong to.


[NOTE]
====
If a user group belongs to another user group, it inherits privileges from its parent group.
====

include::{path}/group-privileges.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot also has a default group called `All`. When you create new users in ThoughtSpot, they are automatically added to `All`. By default, the members of the `All` group do not have permission to download or upload data. To add these privileges, you can use the Group API endpoints.
