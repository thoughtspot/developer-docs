:page-description: Use REST API SDKs to call APIs in a language-specific way.

ThoughtSpot provides native SDK libraries to help client applications call REST APIs in a specific language format.

Currently, the REST API client libraries are available for xref:rest-api-sdk-typescript.adoc[TypeScript] and xref:rest-api-java-sdk.adoc[Java]. These SDKs provide language-specific client libraries to call APIs from client applications.
