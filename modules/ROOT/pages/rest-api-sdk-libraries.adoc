:page-description: Use REST API SDKs to call APIs in a language-specific way.

ThoughtSpot provides native SDK libraries to help client applications call REST APIs in a specific language format.

Currently, the REST API client libraries are available for TypeScript. This client library includes classes that correspond to the resource elements and data types that the API uses when processing requests and responses.

For more information about the TypeScript SDK and its usage, see xref:rest-api-sdk-typescript.adoc[TypeScript SDK].
