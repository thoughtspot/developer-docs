:page-description: Security settings for embedding


The **Security Settings** page in ThoughtSpot UI allows administrators and developers to configure Content Security Policy (CSP), Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), authentication, and access control settings.

[NOTE]
====
The following settings on the **Security Settings** page appear as locked for ThoughtSpot Analytics application users. These settings apply to ThoughtSpot embedding and require an embedding license:

* xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-viz-embed-hosts[CSP visual embed hosts]
* xref:security-settings.adoc#cors-hosts[CORS whitelisted domains]
* xref:security-settings.adoc#_block_access_to_non_embedded_thoughtspot_pages[Block non-embed full app access]
* xref:configure-saml.adoc#saml-redirect[SAML redirect domains]
* xref:trusted-authentication.adoc[Trusted authentication]

== Security settings for ThoughtSpot embedding

Most web browsers block cross-site scripting, cross-domain requests, and third-party cookies by default. Web browsers also have built-in security mechanisms such as same-origin and content security policies. These policies restrict how applications and scripts from one origin (domain) can interact with the resources hosted on another origin (domain). If you are embedding ThoughtSpot content in your application page, you can choose to implement xref:trusted-auth-sdk.adoc[cookieless authentication]. If using cookie-based authentication, make sure to configure CORS settings.


////
** CORS
+
To allow your application to call ThoughtSpot, access its resources, and render embedded content, you must add your domain as a trusted host and enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

** CSP
+
To allow your application to embed ThoughtSpot and access its content via web browsers, add your application domain as a trusted host in the CSP allowlist. You need to also add the domain URLs to the `connect-src` allowlist to load script interfaces and allow Javascript events.

[#csp-viz-embed-hosts]
=== Add CSP visual embed hosts
To allow your host domain to set the `frame-ancestors` CSP policy header and embed a ThoughtSpot object within your application frame, add your application domain as a CSP visual embed host.

. Log in to your ThoughtSpot application instance.
. For classic experience, click *Developer*.
** If you are using the new experience, click the Application switcher image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] > *Developer*.
. Go to *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit*.
. In the *CSP visual embed hosts* text box, add the domain names. For valid domain name formats, See xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-cors-hosts[Domain name format for CSP and CORS configuration].
. Click *Save changes*.

[NOTE]
====
Only users with valid embed license can add Visual Embed hosts.
====

[#csp-connect-src]
=== Add URLs to CSP connect-src allowlist
If you plan to create custom actions with URL targets, you must add the domain names of these URLs to the `CSP connect-src` allowlist. This allows JavaScript events triggered by the custom action URLs.

. Log in to your ThoughtSpot application instance.
. For classic experience, click *Developer*.
** If you are using the new experience, click the Application switcher image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] > *Developer*.
. Go to *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit*.
. In the *CSP connect-src domains* text box, add the domain names. For valid domain name formats, See xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-cors-hosts[Domain name format for CSP and CORS configuration].
. Click *Save changes*.

[#cors-hosts]
=== Enable CORS

The CORS configuration for your cluster controls which domains can access and modify your application content. To allow your application to call ThoughtSpot or its REST API endpoints, and request resources, you must add your application domain to the CORS allowlist. For example, if your website is hosted on the `example.com` domain and the embedded ThoughtSpot content is hosted on the `example.thoughtspot.com`, you must add the `example.com` domain to the CORS allowlist for cross-domain communication. You can also add `\http://localhost:8080` to the CORS allowlist to test your deployments locally. However, we recommend that you disable `localhost` access in production environments.

If you enable CORS for your application domain, ThoughtSpot adds the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its API responses when your host application sends a request to ThoughtSpot.

To add domain names to the CORS allowlist, follow these steps:

. Log in to your ThoughtSpot application instance.
. For classic experience, click *Developer*.
** If you are using the new experience, click the Application switcher image:./images/app_switcher.png[the app switcher menu] > *Developer*.
. Under *Customizations* > *Security settings*.
. Click *Edit*.
. In the *CORS whitelisted domains* text box, add the domain names. For valid domain name formats, See xref:security-settings.adoc#csp-cors-hosts[Domain name format for CSP and CORS configuration].
. Click *Save changes*.

=== Block access to non-embedded ThoughtSpot pages

If you have embedded ThoughtSpot content in your app, you may want your users to access only the ThoughtSpot pages embedded within the context of your host app.

If you have embedded ThoughtSpot using Visual Embed SDK v1.22.0 or later, the `blockNonEmbedFullAppAccess` property in the SDK is set to `true` by default. Due to this, your application users cannot access or navigate to the ThoughtSpot application experience outside the context of your app.

If you are not using Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot, you can turn on the *Block non-embed full app access* feature on the *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Security Settings* page. This will restrict your users from opening non-embedded ThoughtSpot pages from their embedded app context. Note that this feature does not restrict ThoughtSpot users with administrator or developer privileges from accessing ThoughtSpot pages.

== Add trusted domains to CSP allowlists

To import images, fonts, and stylesheets from external sites, or load the content from an external site using an iFrame element, you must add the source URLs as trusted domains in the CSP allowlist.
For example, in the Liveboard Note tiles, if you want to insert an image from an external site or embed content from an external site in an iFrame, you must add domain URLs of these sites to the CSP allowList. Similarly, to import fonts and custom styles from an external source, you must add the source URL as a trusted domain in ThoughtSpot.

The following CSP settings are available on the ** Develop** > *Customizations* > *Security Settings* page:

* *CSP img-src domains* +
Add the domains from which you want to load images and favicons.
* *CSP font-src domains* +
Add the domains from which you want to load fonts.
* *CSP style-src domains* +
Add the domains from which you want to load stylesheets.
* *CSP frame-src domains* +
Add the iframe source URL domains.

[NOTE]
====
If your application instance has Orgs, the CSP settings can be configured only at the cluster level.

[#csp-cors-hosts]
== Domain name format for CSP and CORS configuration

[IMPORTANT]
====
[#port-protocol]
Note the following points if using port or protocol in the domain name string:

* The UI allows you to add a domain URL with or without the protocol (`http/https`) in the CSP allowlist. To avoid long URLs in the CSP header, we recommend that you don't include the protocol in the domain name string. However, for non-HTTPS domains, such as your local testing environment, do include `http` in the domain name string.
* Although you can add a domain URL with the protocol (`http/https`) to the CORS allowlist, ThoughtSpot ignores the protocol in the domain names of CORS hosts. Therefore, you can exclude the protocol in the domain name strings.
* If your domain URL has a non-standard port such as 8080, specify the port number in the domain name string.
* You can add multiple domain names to the CORS and CSP Visual Embed hosts list on the **Develop** > **Security Settings** page. Ensure that the CORS and CSP host allowlist does not exceed 4096 characters.

The following table shows the valid domain name strings for the CORS and CSP allowlists.
