s|When to use|The SDK Supports all embed and customization use cases. Use the SDK for embedding ThoughtSpot if your host platform allows custom Javascript.
|Use this method only if your host platform doesn't allow custom Javascript. This method involves embedding a ThoughtSpot component in an iFrame.| The legacy embedding method is available for only ThoughtSpot Software deployments. With this method, you can embed a ThoughtSpot page, object, or the full application using `api.min.js` script.

== Embed using REST APIs

ThoughtSpot REST API framework supports data APIs, using which you can embed an answer, Liveboard, or a specific visualization from a Liveboard. You can use these APIs with or without the SDK to embed ThoughtSpot content in your app.

For more information, see the following pages:

* xref:embed-rest-api.adoc[Embed using REST APIs]
* xref:custom-viz-rest-api.adoc[Create a custom visualization using REST APIs]
