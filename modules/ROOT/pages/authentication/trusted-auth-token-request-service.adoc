:page-description: You can configure support for token-based authentication service on ThoughtSpot.

== Overview
The *token request service* is the portion of the web application with access to the ThoughtSpot `xref:trusted-auth-secret-key.adoc[secret_key]` that issues the request to ThoughtSpot to generate tokens.

In most cases, the *token request service* is a REST API endpoint added to the web application. Providing a REST API service allows the Visual Embed SDK to request new tokens whenever they are needed to start a new ThoughtSpot session.

The `init()` function calls the *token request service* endpoint, which returns the *token* to the web browser, triggering the Visual Embed SDK to handle the rest of the login flow. The token request can instead happen on the back-end of the web app and the token can be embedded into the returned web page directly, but this will require a page reload if there is a need for a new token.

There are no requirements for how the *token request service* is built or hosted, other than being able to issue REST API commands to the ThoughtSpot instance and having access to the `secret_key`.  When using a ThoughtSpot cloud instance, the authenticator service will need outbound request access to the hosted ThoughtSpot cloud instance.

Trusted authentication tokens can be requested in a way that creates users and assigns them at the time of login. Please see the full documentation of xref:just-in-time-provisioning.adoc[just-in-time provisioning] for implementation details.

== Quick code example
Every web application framework has its own way of handling users, sessions, and making REST API requests to other services.

The following example shows how a *token request service* might look in Node.js with Express and the `express-session` package used to manage a session in the embedding web application.

[source,javascript]
----
app.get('/ts-token',(req,res) => {
  // req.session will be set by another endpoint handling login into the web application
  session=req.session;
  
 // secret_key must be stored securely; here we assume the ThoughtSpot server name and secret_key are stored in env file
 let thoughtspot_url = process.env.TS_SERVER_URI;
 let thoughtspot_secret_key = process.env.TS_SECRET_KEY;

  // Short-time out for cookie-based login; make longer for cookieless
  const timeoutInSec = 60; 

  // Assuming 'user_email' is the session value that matches the username in ThoughtSpot
  if (session.user_email) {
        let tsTokenUrl = thoughtspot_url + "api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full";
        let tsTokenBody = {
            "username": session.user_email,
            "org_id" : 0,  // May need to make a variable, if customers are on different orgs
            "validity_time_in_sec": timeoutInSec,
            "auto_create": false,
            "secret_key": thoughtspot_secret_key
        };
        // using Fetch to make HTTP request; you may use other package
        const response = await fetch(tsTokenUrl, {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify(tsTokenBody),
          headers: { Accept: "application/json",
                     "X-Requested-By": "ThoughtSpot",
                     "Content-Type": "application/json"
          }
        });

        const results = await response.json();
        res.send(results.token);
    }
    else{
        res.send('No user session exists');
    }
})

== Store the secret key
The `secret_key` allows a REST API request for a login token for *any username*, without any additional authentication to the ThoughtSpot cluster.

This means the `secret_key` must be stored by the *token request service* securely and never revealed to the user in their browser. How you store the `secret_key` so that the *token request service* has access will depend on your web application backend.

Any examples you may find using the `secret_key` from a front-end page are purely *for testing only*.

ThoughtSpot generates a new `xref:trusted-auth-secret-key.adoc[secret_key]` when trusted authentication is enabled on a ThoughtSpot instance. See the xref:trusted-auth-secret-key.adoc[secret_key documentation] for more details.

== Authenticate the user
The *token request service* must access the authentication details of the web application logged-in user (at minimum, the *ThoughtSpot username* value), and then use those values in the subsequent REST API requests to ThoughtSpot.

Authentication details are often accessed from:

* Web application's user session
* JWT token included in the request
* LDAP or AD details

If your *token request service* must also create users and give them access, additional authentication details must be accessed:

* user email address +
* user display name +
* ThoughtSpot group names to add a user to +
* Org ID to which the user belongs +

*User password is not required* in the login token request when using the `secret_key`. 

ThoughtSpot user account passwords are neither checked nor modified by any single sign-on method.

== Login token REST API requests
If you are using ThoughtSpot Cloud, the best practice is to use xref:authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-v2[V2 REST API Full Access Tokens].

Access control in ThoughtSpot (called Sharing) prohibits a signed-in user from loading any content to which they don't have access. Access control (sharing) can be granted during the login token request process by adding the user to the appropriate ThoughtSpot groups.

Tokens obtained via REST API v2 endpoints tokens can be used for cookie-based or cookieless trusted authentication. REST API v1 login tokens only work for cookie-based trusted authentication.

The `/session/token/login` REST API v1 endpoint used by the Visual Embed SDK can accept the token obtained via REST API v1 or v2 endpoint to establish a ThoughtSpot session.

If you are on an older software release, please use the features that are available in your deployed release.

=== V2 REST API
The REST API v2 has separate endpoints for requesting full access or object access tokens. The vast majority of implementations use a full access token obtained via `xref:authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-v2[/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full]` API endpoint.

The quick code example above shows how the REST API v2 full access token request would be implemented within a *token request service*.

=== REST API v1 token requests

The REST API v1 tokens are requested from the xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[/tspublic/v1/session/login/token] endpoint.

When a token has been requested in `FULL` mode, it will create a full ThoughtSpot session in the browser and application. The token for `FULL` access mode persists through several sessions and stays valid until another token is generated.

You can request a limited token using the `access_level=REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` option in REST API v1 but this is rarely used and not recommended.

=== Login token expiration

Login tokens obtained from the V1 and V2 REST APIs have different expiration rules.

==== V2 token
The V2 REST API token is a standard OAuth 2.0 token that encodes several properties within the token, most notably the username and the expiration time.

The validity time of the token is never extended by any activity, so a new token must be requested after the initial token passes its expiration time. The Visual Embed SDK can be configured to xref:trusted-auth-sdk.adoc#session-length[handle this automatically].

The V2 token REST API endpoint has a request argument called `validity_time_in_sec` that defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes). 

For cookie-based trusted authentication, you may want to shorten the `validity_time_in_sec` to less than one minute, since the token is only used once and then there is a long-lived cookie-based session. The ThoughtSpot session end time will extend naturally as the user interacts with ThoughtSpot.

For cookieless trusted authentication, you will want to request the token with a longer validity, possibly 20 or 30 minutes, or more.

==== V1 token
The V1 REST API login token is a proprietary token format that cannot be decoded or used for any purpose other than to create a ThoughtSpot session.

V1 tokens stay valid for a length of time based on the following rules:

* A token stays valid indefinitely until another token for any user is generated.
* When a new token is generated using the same `secret_key`, the previous token will expire after five minutes.
* When a new `secret_key` is generated for the ThoughtSpot server, and the first new login token is obtained using the new `secret_key`, all tokens generated using the previous `secret_key` become invalid.
* If users make multiple attempts to log in to ThoughtSpot using an invalid or expired token, they may get locked out of their accounts.

To set a consistent five-minute expiration time, you can generate a second token to start the expiration clock for the previous login token that is sent to the user's browser.

== Org-enabled clusters
On multi-tenant clusters with xref:orgs.adoc[Orgs] enabled, tokens are scoped to one given Org at a time. The *token request service* will also need to be aware of the `org_id` of the matching ThoughtSpot org for a given user at token request time.

== Revoking a token
There is a xref:authentication.adoc#revoke-a-token[REST API for revoking a V2 Token], which could be incorporated into an additional endpoint of the *token request service* if you have concerns about the longer-lived tokens existing beyond the web application's session lifespan.

For example, the sign-out process of the web application could call the *token request service* to revoke the previously requested token.

== Code examples
The following two examples are for *testing purposes only*. They establish *token request services* using all REST API calls correctly, but allow an arbitrary request for a token for any user from the browser.

Feel free to use these examples to start your implementations, but please remove the ability to request any token for any user when building your production version.

The following is a C# example of the ThoughtSpot token request, to be used within a REST API service in the .Net platform, storing the `secret_key` in Azure Key Vault:
[source,c#]
----
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
// For Azure Key Vault
using Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication;

// This example does not include any of the .Net / ASP REST API code
// but simply defines the Request and Response classes necessary for Full Token Request

public class TSFullTokenRequest
{
    public string username  {get; set;}
    public string? password {get; set;}
    public string? secret_key {get; set;}
    public int validity_time_in_sec {get; set;}
    public int? org_id {get; set;}
    public string? display_name {get; set;}
    public bool? auto_create {get; set;}
}

public class TSTokenScope {
    public string access_type {get; set;}
    public int org_id {get; set;}
    public string? metadata_id {get; set;}
}

public class TSFullTokenResponse
{
    public string token {get; set;}
    public int creation_time_in_millis {get; set;}
    public int expiration_time_in_milis {get; set;}
    public TSTokenScope scope {get; set;}
    public string valid_for_user_id {get; set;}
    public string valid_for_username {get; set;}
}

public static httpClient = new HttpClient();

var tsHost = 'https://{}.thoughtspot.cloud';

var tsTokenEndpoint = '/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/full';
var fullEndpoint = tsHost + tsTokenEndpoint;

// secret_key stored in the Azure Key Valut
var azureServiceTokenProvider = new AzureServiceTokenProvider();        
KeyVaultClient kvc = new KeyVaultClient(azureServiceTokenProvider.KeyVaultTokenCallback);
SecretBundle tsSecretKey = kvc.GetSecretAsync(baseUrl, "tsSecretKey").Result;

TSFullTokenRequest tsTokenRequest = new (){
    username = 'usernameFromAuthMiddleware',
    secret_key = tsSecretKey.Value,
    validity_time_in_sec = 30
};

// Ignore any null properties when serializing
JsonSerializerOptions options = new()
{
    DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull;
};

string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize<TSFullTokenRequest>(tsTokenRequest, options);

var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(fullEndpoint, jsonString);
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    TSFullTokenResponse tsTokenResp = JsonSerializer.Deserialize(responseContent, TSFullTokenResponse, options);
    string token = tsTokenResp.token;
    // Return token string from the API endpoint
}

else
{
    // handle error, return error from the API endpoint
}

== Implement token login without the Visual Embed SDK
The Visual Embed SDK handles the final REST API request to create the session, but it is possible to perform the login using xref:session-api.adoc#session-loginToken[/session/login/token] or the xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc#_authentication[ REST API v2.0 token access endpoints]. For more information, see xref:api-auth-session.adoc#_authenticate_and_log_in_with_a_token_trusted_authentication[REST API v1 authentication] and xref:authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-v2[REST API v2.0 authentication].

[NOTE]
====
The REST API v1 `session/login/token` and v2.0 token access endpoints are not used for establishing a REST API session for backend processes or administration scripts. Use the xref:session-api.adoc#session-login[/session/login] endpoint with `username` and `password` to create a REST API session.

////
* The REST API v2.0 allows using bearer or trusted authentication tokens. The authentication tokens obtained from REST API separate from the REST API v1 login token.
////
====

////
REST API clients can make a `GET` or `POST` API call to the xref:session-api.adoc#session-loginToken[tspublic/v1/session/login/token] API endpoint to log in a user. Note that the `GET` call to the `tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint must include a fully-encoded URL with the authentication token and resource endpoint in the request URL.

----

ThoughtSpot recommends sending the authentication attributes in a `POST` request body instead of a `GET` call.

----
curl -X POST \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'username=tsuser&auth_token=JHNoaXJvMSRTSEEtMjU2JDUwMDAwMCRtL3dWcVo2ZTdWTzYvemdXN1ZoaTh3PT0kdmlyNnQ4NHlwYXlqNFV4VzBpRlNYbmQ1bzk5T1RFK2NVZy9ZRUhvUEkvST0&redirect_url=https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/?embedV2=true#/pinboard/7a9a6715-e154-431b-baaf-7b58246c13dd%2F' \
'https://{ThoughtSpot-Host}/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/session/login/token'
----

The API request must include the following attributes:

* `username` +
_String_. The `username` of the user requesting access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

* `auth_token` +
_String_. The authentication token obtained for the user.

* `redirect_url` +
_String_. The URL to which the user is redirected after successful authentication.
