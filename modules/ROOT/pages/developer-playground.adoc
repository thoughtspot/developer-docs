----
runtimeFilters: [{
    columnName: 'color',
    operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
    values: ['red']

++++

a|**Add search tokens** +

Allows you to pass search tokens as query string and execute search.

The following example shows how to create a search a `searchTokenString` and execute search:


[source, Javascript]
----
searchOptions: {
    searchTokenString: '[product][sales][date].daily',
    executeSearch: true,
}
